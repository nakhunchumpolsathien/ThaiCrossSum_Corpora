i was very excited to receive this phone because it is beautiful and functional
this would have been a wonderful product
no wonder no one reads good literature
i purchased two of these as gifts
the sound quality is pretty good though aside from that one annoying noise
just keep looking for anything else
the price should have been better compared with others
the little bar in the middle is now completely gone so all i have left to connect the water bottle are flimsy wires hanging down from it
great gift for kids that are n't used to collecting
however it has lost its color and now is just a clear case with little dots of blue
there is a funny odor when you open them nothing over powering though
overall seems sturdy enough
wo n't be buying again from this vendor
i liked the idea of a rechargeable speaker that did not require batteries as well as having both sound and phone capabilities
the author is very concerned about the idea of god having a personal relationship with people
i do n't particularly care for these but my cat does
while this book gives an outline of how to learn the basics and make changes in your life it does not give practical guidance on making these changes
do n't waste your money very disappointed need to stick with my regular pans
it was interesting with the ending although not my favorite because while i 'm looking forward for the next story arc about these characters it 's getting kind of repetitive reading about them going back to school at college
so we returned it
i expect better from cuisinart
it takes a lot just one scoop to fill it up
you really need one of these before spending many hours going through other types available in stores
i was trying out one from amazon but after the first use i did n't want another one
there are plenty of other books out there to read
this one might have worked great if only it had one
we had used one of these units at work
i plugged it in and turned my speakers on low or nothing but with no audio coming out i put this thing back into the box
it has nothing that will blow your mind
i purchased a dell inspiron 9400 through amazon and the adapter cable was not included but there is an option of purchasing it with or without the adapter
so i decided on this thing to give it a shot
they have admitted no mistake or defect and wanted $ 10 cash instead of sending another order so i could keep them
there is nothing authentic about anything
do not waste your money it 's better to spend an extra $ 100 $ 200 if you want something that works more than 6 months when most products will only last 12 years at most
the photography is poor quality
the author really did n't go into much great detail about what happened to them
my main criticism is the sound reproduction volume
00 and it 's totally unacceptable
my biggest complaint though is that the book started out interestingly enough but then lost my interest in about thirty pages
i have a dslr and loved my d60 but the body is smaller and it does n't seem very professional
my dog never even tried this and it is being given to him as a treat
it lasted exactly six months when the wire near where you connect to ipod started popping apart from earpiece
nothing new in this book ; no more than what can be found at your health department website
there are some great insights into different religious beliefs and philosophies buddhism hinduism jainism especially if you already understand them but for those who have n't these stories will be very hard reads
however i will read the sequel just because who knows someday we may get more of this series
this is just a reprint of the classic article in ' consumer reports ' that has also been printed many times on other websites e
and why do all these things happen only about six months later ? it 's hard not to fall asleep
if you keep buying items from amazon like this one do n't expect any support just return it
however they say that it 's most likely to fit your hp pavillion dv6 just take a chance and it will happen
the storyline is good but there are a few things missing from the story
this item is very cute to look at but it did not last
in a nutshell it is an account of one woman 's journey through life using techniques that can only really be described as off his rocker
i 'm a professional photographer and also use highend dslr equipment for work so i am used to having both high quality lenses on hand at all times and a tripod
i 've installed many screen protectors before but this one is not easy and did not have a tab or small sticker to help make it easier
just got mine and while it might be my fault for not taking out the cd beforehand in hindsight i 'd have saved a few bucks instead of ordering this thing
i just bought this and it is very light and weak
when you talk with people it 's hard trying to get them into your hear also
well mine came today which was good
also does n't go into detail
save your money do not buy this
the dvd set does the show no justice though
my wife purchased this product based upon price which is good for such an inexpensive item
very disappointing will try next year but if there are no results from the dogs i wo n't waste my money again
hopefully amazon will offer this in another model as well
how do people say this is good christian literature about being saved or having faith ? in any case save your time reading it
if you want a short book this one has an average length it was fun to read but the book did n't do any thing but make me think about how i can be more appreciative of my work
do n't waste money on this garbage
these two guys seem like good guys so let 's help them promote their best selling cd's
just did n't sit well with me felt like there were too many things not mentioned or left out of one sentence and it went on forever about something i 'd never cared about
so disappointing that this final novel did n't do it justice just sad
i was excited to see that this book had recipes specifically written for the diet and my friends were also interested because i love food but i 'm very disappointed after trying a few new healthy desserts i 've found 2 of them not even close to being low calorie as those in the book
so now i have glitter everywhere and also very difficult to wash up
it 's a great product
the main characters were never fully explored nor did they have their own depth
it 's not that there are many wrong words but i 'm used to good sentences from better authors
the setting was interesting even if all of the zombiefied people looked similar as others said before
there were many dead spots in the cable
however it was too much for me
we are still using it until we find another way around that problem
you cannot feel anything
and no i 've tried using different filters but same results ; horrible tasting water
the book is a good read however i had to return it back because the print was very small
the only way that we can get action from the remote turn off or change volume are by hitting various combination combinations until something
they were soft and really looked cute
the velcro was too long as well it was like 23 inches in total making a mess
a complete ripoff as my memory in the other 2 is too bad for me to get much out of but i can tell you what i did like
my guess is that this film would look great in widescreen on dvd
i ordered two packs of these bulbs from this seller
the camera worked well in some lighting conditions and poor or not at all with others
if you 're looking for good fiction do n't waste your time or money
i really did not care for the book
the rest of us are going to have to work hard to get our wives and husbands doing what we say they should be doing
it took forever to come in and when we finally got it it did n't work
however it 's not what we expected
one thing that made me disappointed was its not written by john gruber
it was so boring i thought that the kids were cute and interesting but as soon as they left home it made no sense
if you are looking or new vampire romance then move on it seems like such a fun concept
both worked on the first try and they both failed upon returning home
i can see why one person would like more descriptive writing
i do n't know why people still do that
they say go at it alone but that is not how it 's done
unfortunately when plugged into my computer dell it did not register on computer
it felt to short and really did n't have enough depth or character development
i had read somewhere that the big dogs are being killed off and now it has happened
i 'm just amazed at how many times this author gets it wrong
in conclusion if you 're going cheap
this makes this reader wonder if he lived or died
i 'm taking back every single package of these useless pills
perhaps another reviewer has suggested adding more descriptive sentences for further description or setting scenes to make them feel more realistic
i have not read the book yet
these towels seemed really nice to me when they arrived
it 's now sitting on his desk collecting dust since we ca n't even use it
we purchased this adapter a few months ago and now the cable has fallen apart
i probably would just sell it or put clear nail polish over it
to be fair it does give some interesting perspective on a very dangerous and sad time in history
i would have tossed this piece of junk before purchasing any keurig system
in future products they should use something that is n't smelly
it 's about $ 10 much better than this disc
not working
the price was very cheap and when they do work you can get some hours of real use from them
he 's still probably trying to catch our attention
there are too many different stories going on at the same time not enough time devoted in any one story
it arrived on time and well packaged
if you want a good overall understanding of how to run your business in 2011 i would suggest other resources like [
however after 1 week of usage i 've realized that this is definitely not original hp battery
there are many better out there that work
i was drawn to the cover of this book because it looks so beautiful and enticing
if i were reading this type of story to a classroom i 'd recommend something like harry potter well written
if you must buy this camera get a camera with an image stabilization feature or do without one since shutter speed can make all those little shakes look like blurry images
we should have bought more bags
the apps are not at all compatible between them but when we tried to connect them by accident there were no more apps available than when we had gotten our first one
it looked nice and compact though i will give them credit though
save up to get a quality item
the cameras are a bit slow to start up also takes forever between pictures
you will be laughing so hard you will cry your eyes out or maybe both
one other reviewer said it does not work well on ink that is too new
there 's nothing worth reading at all here
you can hardly beat that kind of performance rate for $ 45 bucks go ahead try it after all it 's not like you ca n't afford it
you have to go and find a bunch of things in order to make them work like buying an extension cord for one thing you may want or get at the store that can turn on a fan in your bathroom in winter take off your socks before bed cause they 're freezing up and put some lotion on etc etc
this book had no connection at all
not going to waste time reading anything else this writer pens
i 'm glad this was only 99cents but that 's about all it 's worth now
there 's not much new material here there 's too many anecdotes from people who 've made it big through various means of manipulation or outright scams
i ordered this one not knowing it was for a smaller phone but when my husband opened and tried it he could n't access your phone contacts on the touchstone
however the good part is it came in on time
i bought this product because it had great reviews but when the first batch of eggs were cooked they turned out a bit too hard in taste for my taste maybe they need to have some liquid boiling point and then add water at those temps
the disks skip when they play obvious so it 's not worth having if its new condition
the only way to get this thing through the gate is to lift two small black bars that hang over each side of a horizontal post and then since it 's an unlatched gate you have no real place else to go
while there is certainly good information in the book you can find everything on any random blog or wiki
which means they 've had the same experience as i had
i 'm sorry but this book just sucked
that does n't make any sense
like another reviewer stated my book case broke in two places on the first day i used it
this book seemed too predictable almost like something you would see on lifetime channel or something
if i 'd wanted anything from that man in any way or been responsible enough myself i would give him back his money immediately
it would n't turn off
did n't even have a strong finish
thanks again love your products
the sex scenes also was kind of lame did not add anything interesting or interesting
if your smart dog or perhaps even if they are super smart does n't chew pieces off then you should buy this
the first few games are alright but they are quite challenging when you come across a hard level like this and most importantly the game is not worth what it costs
and since i 'd rather not support someone who blatantly takes advantage of others with little if any regards toward their own property i want amazon customers know they ca n't expect things like this
if however you plan on adjusting these features then do not buy this
so i read the reviews and then ordered it
and the ending was really disappointing
while it does make beautiful foam its noise makes me run back for my old foam pillow which is actually not terribly noisy
it was an okay read
bought for my dog after reading great reviews about it
however other than that it 's barely average
in the first two books a couple of plots and twists were well written
and what made this one even worse everything went wrong from page 1 without you ever feeling sorry for them
to be fair i 'm not sure how they arrived the way these did but each of the four containers were bent in half and i do n't know if this was a fluke or all four
why introduce them then when they do n't really go anywhere
this book is poorly organized
in the past i have known some people to like a particular movie or tv series more than others and at first glance would recommend that one over another after they get into it with their friends however there are always exceptions which is where this review comes in
read them or forget it as this book isnt ' worth your time
not happy with amazon in any way they are more descriptive then the manufacturer
i was so excited when i found out about this product however it did n't do what they advertise at all
otherwise just add an egg
but it works so there is n't too much that was bad about it
i would recommend it for a new student who wants to learn more about cooking at home on one of their own budget or if they travel alot no cook off hotel than the regular hotel kitchens most meals cost around 10 dollars
maybe i will just have to buy more new chargers
first i got this cable plugged in and it worked fine so i went home
the plastic holder that holds it to your head does not hold it steady at all
but to my dissapointment they do n't really do much in this size pack
just be careful when placing items on your wish list
maybe i 'm missing something i could n't tell you
i thought the storyline was weak
the other thing of note is that it takes a great deal of time & effort to do this and only those who actually care enough in their lives for it
that is why 3 stars
this was okay but i do n't think it is the best of all things to buy
this book is almost unreadable
at least vampires seem to be real after all is n't it ? they have feelings like real people
in each episode that did play it was garbled all the way through
try connecting your devices directly to router then try browsing for files
well guess what ?? wrong
however what they use as dried bones is definitely not ' fresh '
it 's a great concept and once they get the hang of it it 's awesome
great story line and characterization
i bought several of these as gifts
it came in a very flimsy box which had tape all over it
the first 2 episodes are a total rip off
would not purchase these sheets had to buy other sheet sets
then i figured that it could be my fault for not being sure where to put it and bought another one since its supposed to be good in the beginning
it did seem like the characters were a little bit two dimensional
but i 'd look at some other brands that are better quality such as vtech
i 've always loved this band and wanted to support them in any way i can
save your money the content in this book can easily be found through google searches
the last part about god made up for it though do n't get me wrong i 'm happy she still had faith and was able to find her way
the idea of an album consisting mainly or all by a single artist is enticing and this one does have enough good music that 's worth your time
it was very simple to install and use but it did not work after few weeks of use
the sound came in very fuzzy & muffled
he also gives some insight into why we should have real journalism because people like glenn beck are constantly trying to trick us all
do not buy unless you have the patience of job i wish there was a 0 star rating
amazon needs to really look into packaging or make sure that items are n't damaged during shipping
and in any case who wants that ? if you really want romance and are looking for that go read beautiful bites or just pick up another story
he has done some excellent work in teaching elementary math but i think dr
not so with me
the book is great until you start learning to build in it and after i spent a total of an hour building this thing and only got about half my money back or nothing im not sure if it 's worth it
the picture cover makes it look like there are illustrations i did not receive them
im looking forward getting my new computer now that will be great cause im leaving college soon for something better
just buy and read it if you want help with painting look elsewhere
there does seem to be some new information available
it 's much better written well more than enough character development and emotion to satisfy even an avid read
not sure what i will try next
the characters are pretty shallow
i did n't order this but someone else did
an enjoyable enough read though
this is even though i let the flash charge for 5 hours
but on an album we have some real dissapointing
not worth even downloading
very disapointing that amazon while they are giving away hundreds of products every year cannot make an item at least with some standard quality
item worked great initially and fit my hp laptop perfectly
but like other reviewers have mentioned some areas are already coming loose
i could not relate to anything in this book except its title which may actually apply better for women authors writing about men
you can make out those phrases if you 've got a really clear memory
but if this was due primarily to packaging i 'm assuming it 's in bluray then i would still recommend buying the movie
it actually reminds me a lot of billy corgan from smashing pumpkins
at least till something better comes along then i 'm switching back
unfortunately for me at least until amazon inc
this was okay as a reference book
it is pure marketing hype disguised as information
it 's more of a karaoke cd that you should buy for your kids
there many better stories from king
now what do i have to do
this is not the dvd series i thought it was do n't get if you are looking for a complete set
there is no way that this product can be labeled as an espresso maker because the filter has a very small hole in it
i bought this remote control
well if you have ever been into bodybuilding like me its pretty much common knowledge that muscle builders need carbs in their diet and that 's how this program works
i could say that there was a very good story to be told but the way this book is written it became quite obvious after a few short pages how the writer wanted you to read it
i feel that if there is a part two then we need to know what happens with michael and samantha ? but otherwise it 's worth reading
i read this book about a month before the election
a few times during the book her personality seemed to change without explanation as well
really ? to add insult to injury when one or other of them finally does do something which involves action like actually fighting it 's not done well
there is no way to repair it
my dog likes it
and it is not good
many things just seemed too generalized or too obvious that you should already know whether you have a job car home friends etc
it feels very light in your hand especially to me who holds knives with all of strength possible i 've got pretty big hands too
the game is fine and the kids really enjoy it
evans at an event and she seemed charming on that interview
the photos and descriptions are beautiful and unfortunately there 's not nearly enough information on making them
the other review for this item is pretty accurate
at least the price was cheap not recommended at all not worth buying
that means you get a lot of information on almost every person in all four women character 's
what good isnt that when you order a cd for someone else ? it was not very clear on amazon either
its very bad when watching movies
the author died before he could finish his own novel so king had more time to work and make this one
the product may be fine but since it 's a key piece i 'm disappointed
it 's written in a matteroffact manner and there are no real questions or information regarding sex so do n't expect any surprises
sounds cheap has that old sounding music
the last part of the book did n't make sense either maybe if someone had reread it ???
and then there 's all the religious stuff what kind of mother is gonna leave her son alone on a bus for hours while she prays to jesus and gets angry at him because he refuses jesus ? you ca n't really put much in his character either
this product was hard to find in stores which really surprised me
if they put more effort into perfecting products like these perhaps someone else will take care better or make things worth buying
it was not nearly as warm or comfy and eventually i realized that if any pressure applied to it like wearing an earband would feel the cold against it
they did n't respond to the issue and they have been waiting for over a week now and still no response from them you get what you pay for i guess ?? it was not worth my time
the cable to plug into my player was broken or shorting so one of my ear phones was n't working
this one is nothing special
buy any other product that has dimensions listed properly
the title says it all i love the concept for this book
it works fine for listening to music while driving in your car but that was not what i specifically bought them for
this guy writes all kinds of stuff with no back up which seems weird to write as if you have them on file
as other people suggested the spine and first two pages will surely start separating with just one or two pen swings
the storyline has many unexpected surprises along the way ; some i saw coming quite easily others just kept surprising me
the words were n't even close to being spelled correctly on some occasions there were no transitions between scenes or chapters either
everything feels forced most of the time unnecessary
the ending of book 2 makes me wonder if there will be a part three though i 'm glad we do n't have to wait long as it 's pretty engaging
but the description of this page here on amazon that states 12pk with 12 glasses is incorrect you only get 1 glass & no 12 cups
however as much as i hate to return items when purchasing online especially things like flour i now know why there was n't more tape
you need to plug the charger into this and it only charges if you use two of three prongs
this video requires an internet connection
i was very excited for this book to be released
the characters were n't developed enough
if you try closing your case but accidentally fold back the front cover of the case then it 's hard for both magnets to turn off as you 're just pushing out against one another
also too many characters whose names did n't flow together
this is our second olympus and they just seem to die faster
this is going straight back
it 's as though she goes to bed gets up at 3 a
got two of the units for a new office and both came without power cords
to add insult there is n't even any indication as to where those pictures could have come from
good thing i bought two batteries
i got this hoping to have good enough pictures at the beach with my camera
however she did find one part the first day or sothat was difficult for her to follow because there were words missing from each page so all you could see on the next line after reading something basically what we imagine people talking like after having sex really weird sentence
i expected a little more from fisher price since its rated as their leading product
she still wo n't eat
he just keeps talking about how nice and warm the weather was
it 's like somebody makes all these things and decides they think no one should buy them so they will sell really cheaply anyway
first off after first configuration you can see that ip of device changes
it has been a great help for me and have saved my self thousands of dollars
what else is in it ? that 's right nothing
at first it made fantastic hot chocolate and espressobut the plastic parts are just too cheap i got my first machine and used it once now only 2 months later its leaking all over where the water tank screws into the machine
what happened here ? if this is n't fraud like what we 've seen in todays marketing ? please change your pricing and fix this otherwise i will be forced into downloading itunes
i liked this book overall but it seemed to end a bit abruptly
but when plugged in you actually got a green light while charging
it 's just bad tasting sugar that works for nothing save your money & go into the pharmacy
there were even small smears on the surface
and now they 're saying it will need repair / replacement
this one will make a great gift though because i 'm so embarrassed about the purchase right now
it seems like everything else on leapfrog products is great
i 'm an amazon customer so i do n't know how one of my products got corrupted / lost but when i started reading this book i could n't put down
and why let him sing ? you did n't make them
the graphics are very good similar to some of other lucasarts titles but the gameplay is pretty limited in comparison to earlier games such as knights of the old republic or tales of xillia not that both were bad games
this was my first james patterson book
was really fun to see it again
no hdmi cable works without audio
this one needs more work
the book is very short of what the title suggests it has some basic information but mostly just a brief review
it would seem to me better design if it could run more than 2 or 3 hours per day and not need constant charging
there are other printers on amazon at similar prices with better reviews
i liked the concept and thought it sounded like an interesting book but as other reviewers stated there are major problems with editing writing grammar punctuation etc
the storyline was very interesting with some historical details
the author is really getting carried away with his description of the various types and lengths of swords
i really wanted to like this book but could n't
when riding you have to hold down all of buttons for an additional 2 seconds before they work so imagine trying to use it while riding
it is hard to use and it does not even clean the carpet well like people said before
i am a fan however this author is getting away from her real strengths in this novel and it 's hard with so many other good ones out there
was he ever found ? why did it take so long to find him ? how is everyone dealing after his death ? he gave everything away just months before to those closest to him
maybe it 's just my bad luck but this worked about a week and then quit working
it has very poor design flaws that allow such a failure
spend 5 more bucks and get something reliable
i am very disappointed as i thought this book was geared for a little older children
this book as others reviewed came across poorly written predictable no depth
we bought two of these for our twins based off all the positive reviews we 've read
do not buy this camera
i would recommand this to all first time parents only if the one wanting or needing books are just beginning
i kept hoping something would happen at each moment to pull me in
they are as nice looking and function well
the first section of little voice did leave us guessing about what 's going on but if you think at all
for about six months after buying it the left speaker started to fade in and out
disappointing they are cute but that was the only positive thing i mean it is not even worth $ 2
first off it took me around 7 hours from beginning to end because i had a hard time finishing it
i was expecting something more than that
the camera had no power when arrived
this one is n't too long and not too short
and i 'm also impressed with how many movies are out there that present more issues but they 're often just superficial messages
i wanted a way to watch netflix thru my pc on the tv
but the price was right no leaks
i also found it strange how one of the two main characters could see ghosts without ever being touched before
it 's good they did n't send something expensive because it 's really not worth returning
it is very nice looking and the material feels well stitched together
so big that they do n't fit snug in my ear and fall out
99 because there are n't anymore books by michael prescott coming out soon
it did n't even match my phone do not buy these total waste of $ 19
just know that if you 're looking for green tea without any caffeine its just fine
do n't buy any products from logitech
they said would return but i did not need to as returning shipping was 1/3 of price if i send back
but for now i 'm off
unfortunately these little things are made like a cheap toy
it was pretty good it just was n't a book that grabbed my attention and would n't leave me with unanswered questions
if anyone has any suggestions or how you make sure your battery stays charged please let me know
with this product you need a straight pipe going through your tub if that makes any sence and yes it does
very sad and pathetic
this is not what they had expected nor would i recommend it
do n't buy it spend your dollars somewhere else
however it only lasted about 2 weeks
you have unfiltered tea on your hands from time to time
he will do anything for his religion that could n't be rightthat 's like saying somebody who does n't believe in aliens or aliens must be wrong
these prices are ridiculous
every track sounds exactly like every other
well it does not
i had heard that this was a good movie but it took awhile for the plot to really take off
do n't waste your money on this item
it happened when there was a lot of bass coming through and it is the main reason why i got these
this is for the full size pillow but it does not hold up as good in washing which i know most people find annoying when washing
i just started reading it last night at my dinner time after dinner
0 products should support before buying anything / anyone
if you are hoping for a little more than just another sex scene well you 're out if hope already
just buy one cd from these four or five wonderful groups instead
and also did help with my allergy problems in one particular room of my entire house so i could breathe freely after using it
the title track paradise does not sound like a new recording and as for most all the songs in general with only 2 exceptions are poorly sung
then there was no help from amazon to replace
the author makes claims about how well his advice to buy used in good condition turns out well but there really was nothing helpful here at all
there is little detail hardly any background and even less info save your money
the game is simple and although this version adds new features at each turn there are points which require an action like shooting your enemy behind cover or more strategy like choosing where and when to activate certain abilities
i wish this man well on his journey
my guess is one day someone will fill it up and spill coffee all over his or her office
they never did after sending me about 11 emails
what good is it if you cant get replacement rotisserie grills ? my only compliant would be putting this together was such a challenge for me as to the parts being hard plastic i felt like i`d break something
read the secret life of marilyn monroe a novel instead
i have been struggling with this book for a few years now and it seems there are two camps of people who find the advice in here to be helpful one being that when you focus on your goals through hard work you will do well
instead it is just in it 's own little envelop
although the tv comes up with an onscreen menu it turns itself off after 10 seconds which is far too soon
the 2nd one has worked great
the video quality was poor compared to other brands
the shift key stopped working properly so if you do some typing in quick succession you need multiple keystrokes just to erase what you 've written
it is one of my favorite authors
this part has more grease fittings than mine or instructions so you have to be careful it does come with three of them
i 'd love to say this had natural ingredients or not but it 's certainly very harsh
after 2 weeks of ownership it would not turn on
when we received this product for christmas my husband said it was cheaply made and did n't look right
buyers should be aware of this
unfortunately after struggling through about 40 pages of boring convoluted characters random historical references that seemed disconnected from the plot for example the first english settlers brought their food with them
the positive note is that the supplier has a very prompt response
i was excited to see this book available in a kindle edition
mine lasted me 2 weeks before one earpiece stopped working properly then within 1 week both speakers started going out
this is definitely defective
first and last time i ordered this product
so really just wasted $ 20
the pacing changes characters are introduced relationships start taking shape etc
buy at walmart or wherever it 's going to take more time for delivery and money
if anyone has seen the first transformers movie they will know what i 'm talking about
the pictures are small in size and not at all detailed enough for one who wants to see each piece or make up his / her own plans
if you are looking to buy for a friend who is in your same situation as you its helpful
but the book could have been so much better if the author did n't use the same old characters with slightly more sophisticated names
never again would i waste any money for this
and when you walk away from your computer it 's like you 're hearing a whole wall of sound that kind are really annoying
good seller fast shipment
it did n't take long before i was up in arms saying there should be an investigation because many people have complained of headaches nausea vomiting etc
it 's no wonder some vendors have been out of business for so many years now poor product build quality
i bought this for my daughter and it barely fits her phone
this is an average read
i am very happy with the quality of this product
i received the wrong size
my kid really had trouble following along in pictures
she had never sang before so she did n't put one person before herself
this is one of my least favorite books in my library it 's kind of sad
it gave some great advice on traveling in new york though so if you can afford for something to break do n't give up it 's a good guidebook
this book is an attempt to help those women who have had a really horrific childhood and now want the happy ending many of us want
thank you so much amazon our hearts were filled with joy
i got this so i could move my shower head away from the wall
but this toy did sit in her food bowl and stayed there for about an hour
as many others said it 's not what you might expect
there were no real high points for me except maybe when i am born and your love is king
however every other time i play it the screen blacks out and does n't come back
maybe this book was n't really all that accurate
the book starts out ok but the revelations at that exact point seem like a product of her having attended some evangelical christian seminary and wanting to share every twist and turn with us in ways any educated person finds tiresome
even on the lowest setting of one highest setting he was able to stick his face down and kick off the back end by pushing against it
i could not get the product to install and it was defective
there is alot better gluten free books on amazon
after reading the material about 5 times i still have questions that do n't seem to be answered in this book
the only thing that is functional about this product is its form factor
dont waste you time or money
good book to read but too predictable
this book is only of interest if the reader has a specific interest in the subject
that is perhaps how life really does go when we live near places like new hope arkansas
it appears that there is a delay on my end with setting up the camera
it does make senseespecially after viewing season 4
or her eyes were shining
they do n't work the second one is not even recognized
it also takes quite a long time for me get off of work so as i 'm driving after getting sent out just gets stuck at the top
the material feels extremely cheap
that is with different headphones
they put them in their own box if he needed pliers you can pretty much count on it i would n't recommend these at all
go for speck one just because that is a better one and cheaper
if anyone knows how long they would last before dimming at least let me know because these led floods cost twice what my previous set did
you dont really need any more words to tell your customers this
while the book does have a lot of excellent information the author really needs to do some research before writing with any amount of authority
and a lot less expensive than some others the others might have been defectivetoo me but not this one
the instructions for the ear pieces tell you not wear them in an enclosed place so please do that also and wash your hands thoroughly after using them
for now they have sent back to me another one which will hopefully work
the only thing missing are screws for each piece which by now there is enough info about online
i will keep them as extra head phones
just my preferance ca n't beat the price
it is clearly marked ice rather than italia
this carafe when you put the lid on is not tight enough to allow the steam pressure within from escaping through it maybe too much pressure while also allowing some liquid through
it is completely useless now
you have to have a magnifying glass and lots of patience in order to figure out if you 're installing the battery correctly or not
i purchased this with the hope it would be great as i 've used a similar product before
it is nice looking but does not work not impressed will look elsewhere
and for all the money that the publishers have made on buying up old authors i think they need to get some fresh blood into their company
ca n't complain with a good read as always just wished for more
as others have said it 's not bad for free thank god though
i 'm sure amazon will take care of me
save yourself time go buy something else
if you are interested in this music then do not purchase this cd
the top part will stay up so we will just put a plastic wrap over it ; it 's basically useless
this book is not for me
i kept reading just to see how it went thinking that there will be an interesting turn or two somewhere along this story something that would make me think wow
a good read though if you want to know what life in nyc and new jersey was like for those involved with or going through world war ii
what a disappointment the color is too bright the animation looks rushed there are too many changes no character introductions or references to previous series the storyline sucks there were a lot more extras in volume 1 including what happened on earth
there 's something about it that bothers me a little ; it 's not great tasting and too chewy
my kids love the series in movie form this was a disappointment
especially after everything they went through throughout their lives which was pretty intense the two main female leads claire and claire are completely different people
hopefully this will be her first book
i have n't finished reading it
after 3 weeks of very light use i find out what is wrong its a loose connection somewhere inside where you can get any debris lodged into it
however once again there seems to be more focus on character development as opposed to plot development
they are not as heavy duty and have a thicker layer of glass with fewer layers than i expected ; therefore it provides less protection
there 's no more info than what could be found without having internet access
first my phone charged 100 % for 48 hrs then 25 % less than 24 hours later
my cat loved it
not a great song just alright
i read this book after reading the book
i guess i 'm not one of those women
i had bought 4 and tried all of them they did n't fit into my car window correctly
when in the vga cable slot my brand new lenovo g570 laptop gets an error message saying there is no signal
the earbuds do n't fit right and after a short time there are so many uncomfortable pressure points on my ears i want to toss them out now have to spend more money for something better
it was n't a good story for me
the icons used for most functions do n't work in normal light conditions
the one drawback which could be a little dangerous if not handled carefully is that when the battery is drained even after charging for 24 hours it shuts down
do not buy cuisinart
but i did like how well made the pole was
we 've even had our toddlers try to get into it
a very interesting study of the life and times leading to wwii in china
i wo n't read any more books in this series
if you want an interesting read on the subject try woman warrior a history of women leading in world war ii by joan wolfe
the box says for nikon d3100 and other compatible digital cameras with efs2s battery adapter
i wasted my money with this
not worth the money even though the return shipping is only $ 7
this review refers only to the kindle edition not the textbook
not very impressive quality from an obviously cheap cable
amazon needs to change their product description completely
the story was a great concept
with all my work gone into photoshop i thought i 'd use that for a while but after running out of disk space on adobe creative suite it got too hot to handle
the dialog between the two main characters are also quite immature for their ages
i bought this as a gift for my girlfriend after getting her the kindle fire and she has been carrying it around with her but even thou my sister loves it there are quite some problems
i 'm going back to starbucks sumatra kcups
/ but like i said ill give her another chance but if there is only 1 part left
for being small this is incredibly noisy
i also ca n't figure out why we keep buying batteries ? it takes d size battery which seem rather expensive considering they are probably only 3 bucks each at any corner drug store
it does not fit the iphone 3g with speck case
that 's just silly thinking
you may want to measure your laptop before ordering this bag
in fact there have been an excess number of reports on this topic and none have claimed a single death which should lead anyone who uses the product to be wary of making unsubstantiated claims
i 'm glad this came up in my search
used product once or twice
could only hear the music
i do n't like books that throw so many details at you
the quality of oxo 's products has declined since we first purchased this brand because their utensils seem thinner and cheaper compared to past purchases
however i 've noticed that it only maintains 75 % charge when connected to an outlet
while it 's installed my printer has started spitting out pages that have streaks on them
i 'm not saying do n't get it just do n't expect it to lead into anything else
how many times can you write how unhappy everyone is ???? you just got tired of reading it it became boring real quick
why go on ? because if it 's true there 's something worse in store for humankind
just goes to show you ca n't stop making them better i think that we have just lost our enthusiasm for these stories and as such it 's going tobe hard to keep buying them or read all six
it made me so mad i decided not read any more amazon books and threw my hard earned dollars away
the reason for 3 stars i like it but would n't love it or get excited if a friend wrote it was because there were several errors which had me going rereading sections twice
bought this for my son last year
after 3 tries my second attempt failed
what is worse hp sent me replacement cartridges which now work great but my machine says they do n't work
this book is probably good for someone who has no idea where they are going yet and does n't need to know anything but what 's stated on the cover page
we have a large adult dachshund and the leash broke
not worth getting stuck paying for shipping twice during our trial period
just needs work on editing
i ordered it twice and both times they told me about the shortage in stock which is absurd as these came from the same seller amazon even though you guys have always been prompt with ordering
not worth sending back
this is a good movie but i am not sure why it made so many stars
big mistake the color is really terrible
the information in here could easily fit into 200 pages at most
when i received the product there was no such thing in the description
it just does not matter
keep at this project
it is slim much thinner than the previous review here says which makes it easy to get into tight spaces
this one seems like someone did some research but forgot to do more as well
i was disappointed in this novel
this book light has four diffrent levels the medium level which makes everything seem brighter than what you 're reading even with low batteries
i wish someone had warned me before wasting my precious time and money on this book
even worse there are only one or two sentences per page
i suppose this means these books need another review and at least a chapter on how you can put them into action
i have owned the imp 3100 for about a month and already its hard to hear what people are saying
as soon as rebooted or powered down they were gone
i found this a great little book that offers many helpful hints in making your own wine
i also like the fact that they tried their hand at using actual facts with the real time crime stories
it 's very bulky and slides out of place easily
it 's just like an ice skater who is looking over his shoulder at every single jump
i have read a handful of these type books and this was one of the worst
the way it started i thought the author would do a great job of keeping you on the edge with all the intrigue and twists but unfortunately that is not how she writes
i could not relate to any of them and could n't understand their actions
there are some useful points and ideas here but not a lot
read all the reviews and decide if you really want to try it or not
do n't waste money buying this it 's just some guy who makes a living selling useless tips
what else can we say about this ? please take 2 seconds to read their return policy
now i 'm shopping around for something more durable
i found quite a bit of humor in this book yet it was too farfetched
a bit too expensive for what you get
too much trouble and expense to send them back
so why is this ? for me it 's an emotional investment because almost every song touches me
if there was an option of negative stars that is just all i 'm willing to do
i am very disappointed in this toy she asked me more than once if santa bought them at an apple store b/c they are that flimsy
but get scratched by keys
the batteries that came with these candles are horrible
the item pictured with this listing and that which amazon ships are completely different even though on their site they state that they do ship these two models yet when you order you will receive either unit or another vacuum
if you do buy this product know there are much better options
the thing about this printer though are not actually penable
there are numerous problems that make even taking pictures almost impossible except when shooting in dark conditions
do n't buy this book
no problems until the battery died
it has become useless as he cannot use it so now i 'm looking for another remote that is better made
also since it 's written by an employee of amazon i 'm curious if those things are correct
these are fine for that although i wo n't buy another set if they 're this size
we have played many wii games & this one bored both her and myself
my issue with the product came after 2 days
the first did not hold up and the second one has never functioned right out of box
all had no effect
these were going directly in my goody bag donation bin at work so no one would know how horrible of an item i purchased if they could see them
oh yeah shipping took longer than expected
this product is n't really what it 's advertised as
do yourself a favor and spend more money
bought this for someone who had already read it before
these are suppose to be 3 1/4 talland more like 2 1/2 or 2
after reading some of the positive reviews i purchased this charger to go with my kindle touch but it does not charge it
what a shame ; i had high hopes especially since they changed their design
too bad that i did not find any useful information on what works or models they use other than their personal success stories
even when they do go into real details their style tends to be dull and boring if you ask me
i would say it 's more of the nature of her breed than anything to do with this
it used to be pretty common for a great many products by reputable manufacturers such as bose sony phillips etc always to have some form of issue with their products
if i had reviewed this book for a class in college when it first came out and then only read the second half of it you probably would n't have wasted your money just on the last samurai as there really is n't anything worth thinking about
not even as bright anymore but still useable
my last camera was an olympus stylus 770 which while it lasted did n't really feel like my first camera not that that should keep you from buying it
i 'm a fan of this series so i wanted to read the entire thing
the material covers the most vital aspects of marketing and customer engagement topics one might wish to consider if they want to build a successful career in both sides of their business
just wish it tasted as good
if you think that this makes for good reading that 's fine
very interesting way of coming together
the main plot line is fine but there are way too many characters who all serve multiple roles and although they seem like different people their story lines are very similar
this is frustrating when you find that half the cups look like there is no coffee while other beans just happen to be in there
well the light comes on but there is nothing going on
you have get the iphone all wet before putting it in then its a struggle getting the rubber piece on properly
i wanted an easy to use case for my kindle fire
its great if your laptop has no hard drive because it only requires three usb ports
these people have obviously never seen the originals
however after having read it i 'm not sure just who or which version to buy
first of all i liked the idea that they were old souls as opposed to young ones
a major waste of money
our 6 year old son was not excited about these like he usually is when offered a new treat
it 's something to consider when ordering
my wife does n't seem bother by this 2 it smells like paint
this is junk plain and simple
this item shipped within one day which was awesome but this is a piece of junk the sound quality is n't that great and it just does n't work
work hard have good credit and save money
the book was very easy to read in the beginning i just found that it had a bunch of boring parts and then it would pick up again with all sorts of details not needed
not durable at all
not what was advertised i got a completely different product entirely for $ 20
i will use it as a conditioner for now however the price of course had to come down somewhat
the mouse is ok and the keyboard takes a while to connect but after one year the screen wo n't take on at all just gets black screens i do n't have any computer experience when it comes to these kinds of problems but its obvious that this model was not built with users in mind
it cleans very well though definitely buy this product
i 'm not sure why people say they love it but i will tell you why
after playing through a few games the action goes way too fast to keep my attention
as stated in the book 's description * you meet a young woman whose sister marries her own brother
also it 's easy to push across the floors but after awhile there is n't much left of it
these cook book recipes can be found all over the internet
29 it 's not worth it
what a big disappointment
so naturally when i saw a cookbook about this subject my excitement went up in flames
my advice is save yourself hassle by paying more for something better
i 'm all about giving credit where its due but for me to call someone 's work brilliant is an understatement
not even on cd
this does an excellent job of getting rid of coffee grounds
my kindle fire hd 7 which has a light that stays on when you open it to wake thing up does n't stay firmly closed
unfortunately within weeks both lamps burned out when left on
in fact my daughter was able to copy and paste some parts from this book
it 's worth spending a little extra on something right ? just this piece is junk
the front cover 's magnetic closure function works perfectly although you ca n't easily read in bed since it flops around on your face
had to replace that as well after about 6 months
i was very excited when i ordered this to replace my old charger that just died on me
perhaps at some time we have assumed that he is an apostate from his true religion
so now the item is still functioning as intended
i 'm extremely pissed off about it
maybe you are expecting something different ? perhaps there should be some sex scene inserted in ? or two people confessing their love at same time
the dog door did not open well at all
i expected a comedy instead everyone talked like they were stoned as you can imagine
it 's too bad cause it looked so good
however right out oif box i was ready cause there is absolutely nothing sturdy about this
the plot was good too
it appears that this product works because the picture showed it worked
you are better off with those 2 or 3 dollar styli not this one
the story jumps around and it 's almost as if you are jumping from one subject to another without any introduction into each subject
but at higher volume levelsit 's less effective
this also means that children cannot read how to properly use them either
terrible product terrible product
i ca n't believe i 'm saying this but this movie really just sucked and did n't live up to it 's promise
they are occasionally difficult to grasp or pronounce properly but the point is it 's just poor writing in general
i did n't really like it as much as the first so that says something the characters were n't very well developed
as another reviewer has done the pillow was too firm so it made my neck & head ache all night
same type of plot but with a much less mysterious ending
it does not provide any additional protection for your phone
the case looks pretty good however when i put on the phone everything was fine it just did n't feel secure as there was n't any way to really keep my iphon from tipping over
i am so disappointed in these headphones the sound quality is good but they cut out whenever someone walks a foot away from my i phone
just wish some better glue was used on making it
but if you are looking for an adapter that will work this is n't it
after charging on the base overnight i went to use it
i will be searching elsewhere to find videos
i ordered this for my father who has a bad knee from an operation 3 years ago received it quickly but when we opened it there were no instructions
but then to read it in such graphic detail was just too much
even without a battery two batteries barely fit they both have one compartment
i thought the house was well produced but this was worse than that
and although it 's advertised a long handle there is no leverage when fully extended
i enjoyed the bookbut was really getting bored by it on chapter 24
it seems to be mostly about the author and her family no answers there
if amazon would take this matter seriously they could make this right then customers should consider making purchases elsewhere
as scifi lots of flying spaceships futuristic technology or perhaps even fantasy which means nothing about how things are
shame on amazon shame on manufacturer
if you 're looking for something interesting then check into the accidental internet guy
the book was not as i expected or hoped very little of the story focuses on the characters which is what drew me to this book
there were lots of things going on but they did n't really connect together
there are plenty of reviews describing the story so i wo n't bore you anymore
wo n't make that mistake again
it did not last long enough to even use it
wait on netflix to show it first because that where i saw it
if i were to compare them with anything other than an upscaled vhs copy they would probably look far better on my tv or vcr
i was expecting a better product but it would cost me 10 times more to ship back than what i paid so my advice is do n't buy the color looks great with the i phone 4 but as soon as you peel off they stickers on it 's coming apart at each and every seam
did n't get to use these batteries as they were defective one after another
it kept me entertained until the last page i could n't put it down
i was expecting a lot more when reading the back cover of this book since it talked about how to have success with women
they know what they are doing
at least three other cheaper organic shampoos managed that
our old one lasted us 6 years which was pretty much as good as i 'd say most appliances do these days
the writing gets so bad that most storylines become tedious
this bag however is n't for you
the rubber in my all of them started to crack after a few months so now when pulling phone out from holder to answer i am more likely damaging it then getting off and on
after putting it out with several gallons of fuel it took us days to get up there because the smoke was so strong
you ca n't just remove it especially if your phone is n't working correctly
it has no bearing or significance on the two previous novels ; at least for me it does n't add anything to them
this thing is hard to clean and the food does n't seem fresh
no wonder most americans are broke so many people in this country will never see their dream come true
a short story but worth a read
just goes over the basic facts about how to save and live well nothing too exciting
be wary of these knock off brands they are cheap for a reason
while this book offers a good historical and personal understanding of the civil war it also gives a great deal about how that war affected the individual citizens of texas
it 's too bad these things ca n't be checked out before they are sold to customers or at least put on the item description when it 's not obvious that it will fall apart
when you think that you 're going to get a nice book with high grade glossy photo reproductions and many full color pages what better way than this book ?? well i was disappointed big time
i bought the same product from a brick and mortar store about 3 months ago
she says it will never happen with her so maybe i 'm mistaken
not sure if it has to do with a damaged item or what but when i put the disk into my xbox one all three of them were defective
after ordering 2 of these and having them ship to me once already where the bottom part does not even sit properly it 's a major problem with this case and they both did it
they are completely useless i ca n't tell you how many times i 've called
it is an insult to readers who want to treat their children with these drugs
you wont regret buying it
bought it for a gift but did n't expect to really like the way it came out
while it is an ok camera do n't have high hopes
a little more work gone into this one if it 's a new book but as it is i would wait until all the editing issues catch up with it
it is designed for those with an ipad 2 or maybe a previous model but definitely not the newest one
when apple converts music files they should do so in a professional way
this is basically a piece of foam covered in plastic wrap that gives very no protection to your laptop or tablet
my cousin also got the exact same phone from verizon for about 70 percent less so we compared them both but my brother 's i 9300 's look brand new i 'm disappointed that they are selling these phones like that
it came close when reading parts of it but i felt disconnected trying to figure out where i had missed a paragraph or who someone was
it 's just thrown in plastic
there were so many negative reviews maybe they had lower quality tools
but as you know before we meet them it 's not clear what it is
save yourself the headache like i did
in my case it was not
it was just a rip off
if someone comes up with something better please let me know but for this it 's okay
a young girl meets a boy at school and has sex with both of them
thanks for having something fun available it also looks cool but since there are only two songs in english and no spanish one my kidwho has not studied spanish is very confused
not worth wasting your time let alone money or time
i only rated it 3 stars because the plastic hinge for screwing into the pot cracked after only two weeks
so when the package arrived there was no way to do anything except cut out an existing part and make it
this product is junk i was looking for something like this to work on my iphone 3gs and it does n't work
if you can accept vampires who are in short supply than its an ok read
i will be buying some others here instead
so if you are considering buying these books please do n't hesitate cause like me your child will be bored after one reading
if you 've never read a james patterson book you might be inclined to believe that they are all wonderful
i just put this in my brand new acer 10
it deserves 0 stars but thats what they make you give them
do n't buy this
you have no clue how this ends when the end is in fact pretty far down
i returned that lamp
i ca n't help but wonder if these guys just sat around gathering data for 5 years after college or something
but upon receiving this item it 's not quite as good as that
still have n't received it
it says to wait 3 days if it has been sitting around and you must add water within 24 hours
good luck if you are trying to do this
my sons were using them at the time but had not used them
there are several other bands with similar names
maybe the next one will work
you can get better information on cooking from magazines
no happy ending but a boring one at that
for $ 10 that included delivery i guess its worth it but do n't expect to get every last bit either
not really sure what is wrong now
well its not what i wanted thought it gave me the info to start out from but no not for any of us i hate the fact that i can make my own book and have it ready in a day all ready
this case did not fit properly
it is not a great price either compared to others
did n't finish the book ; seemed too ' hollywood '
the book was not what i expected at all do n't read this book i did n't have nothing to do with it thank you so much
it was like a bad episode of the big bang theory
i really wish their fans were as sturdy as theirs
i really do n't recommend this product / purchase combination
this seems like false advertising
this book is a complete ripoff and should not have even been offered for sale
like eating right or sleeping
it starts out fun and then quickly turns annoying after a while
this one lasted longer but now has started losing its shape also
not sure why but it takes alot longer to charge my laptop with this charger than previous chargers
i purchased the book thinking it would give my kindle a little more bang for it
also only works with certain types of televisions
more of her thoughts about how people treat her
by the fist week it was broken and would no longer shut on
you have to go through that process again
all thoughts are made into actions rather than dialogues
i used this product with a netgear router as an access point
that said the writing was at least passable until it got to this book
this is not a how to but an autobiography with very little real instruction
the plastic frame broke within 3 years of purchase
she dropped it about 3 ft onto carpet and cracked right down one side then busted up that side
i have to agree with what most people had said
not sure i would trust what was said in it
i was disapointed by the lack of info a lot more pictures than text so there is no way to easily learn the correct procedures for using these tools
if you look online for how do i use this ? you will find about half a dozen answers to which i 'm afraid the others are not practical at all
the concept of a good short story is there but it was n't used with this book
but what more can a mom want from a kids book ? do n't get me wrong i 'm not trying to bash the other reviews
the corners broke off within the first 30 minutes that we used it which was not even using it heavily
when i purchased mine the packaging clearly states that it will work with windows me operating systems
but there are only two things i would criticize the case for first it has no room for anything of substance like cords cables memory cards etc
had hoped theses would do it too but no
when that changes it leads to poor story lines with little or some plot at all
in case you did n't know this means buying lots more fertilizer which you can use afterwards without throwing away all the food
its not even a complete page you can see there is no binding what so ever on that particular page
00 for it very disappointed it is going back pronto
go spend a few extra bucks from someone who can send you an actual working product
i have an old set that was great these are worthless
the author 's portrayal of the subject is very accurate to what has been reported in various news sources
i feel bad for all who paid money thinking they would be getting something
this problem could be fixed by better instructions
this book is definitely dated and not really that great
after trying a number of fm transmitters in the past this one is by far the absolute most disappointing product i 've bought
it was a boring read
not to long or too short
maybe if we had an actual computer the kids that would play this game
the title seems to indicate this is an in depth analysis of the relationship between art and literature but a little research shows it isnt
there were other interesting aspects but they are pushed aside in favor of all this fluff that does n't add anything and really is n't even well written
read these reviews to see what we are talking about
ca n't get volume and on off
i do n't know if this is even close to the brand that my cat actually likes and will eat like crazy for more than 3 minutes
wish someone had written it
after getting into the characters there seemed to be too many filler
i have owned 6 printers all epson
at least in paperback there is some type of physical book binding
i 've tried all sorts of different combinations with the water temp adjuster which does n't come attached like you would see on most other brands anyways in order for my coffee 's temperature to be what works best for me
today was my first time to actually charge the battery
i have an otterbox and it covers more of my phone so this case does not fit
no instructions to begin with i still have not used this product
seems like they would be able to keep up if this were larger in size ? overall a decent product that 's fairly good value
it was an expensive waste of money our previous pair had lasted us for 5 years so what happened ? do not make a mistake from purchasing these invest more money into getting better ones
the game was much loved by both
however it died after only four months of daily use
i am giving them the benefit of the doubt since they do n't know what to make out of as best we can tell
they mention doing 2 coats
for about 5 minutes
not only was it defective but the customer service from this company is horrible i 'm still waiting for them to answer my emails and keep in touch about it
other than that its good
stay away it was just what i wanted until it quit
then the wireless stopped working
glad there are free books as opposed to the $ 2
i am sure many people loved it because its a very good looking picture and sound wise but as far as acting goes no matter how fancy some things are you will always come in second to peter o'toole even though he plays henry v
the only good thing about the movie in my opinion was that the cast included none of today 's more polished actors
if you want an industrial or better material it would have been better
if i put all three tablets in a standard zipped up ziplock bag there is no noticeable difference between that tablet alone or an ipad alone
did anyone else notice how they described one character as being a size 14
that prompted me to send them feedback via amazon
the plot moved very slowly and as many reviewers have pointed out there were way too many points where dialogue seemed repetitious or overdone
it 's cheap and it does n't charge
sometimes you need to tweak some settings with your computer which requires an internet connection
and a waste of money
i was not satisfied with this purchase
did not receive what was ordered
it 's like buying a porn movie
my last samsung phone the model nvu51 c started showing up in my email box after about 2
sorry but that 's just how i feel when trying out new things
if you buy into her account about being abused by her father and mother both alcoholic in an effort to make herself feel better for a long time then you will love it obviously written without any sort of editorial check
it felt unfinished and unfinished
if you like to be taken in by a bad movie that tries very hard but falls flat on its face then this is the film for you it has such obvious plot holes that once they are pointed out it 's too late to return it
and despite me not ever wearing them outside like to walk through snow or water my feet were very sore at the end of every day
i threw mine in the trash
the case is okay to protect my i phone 4 but if you 're used the i phone 's slider as a means of selecting different functionalities on your phone it takes too much time when trying to open that case instead only you can slide into this case
it seems that half of them were returned even though they said new '
i will try this and i 'm glad there 's no sugar in it but i have to say it does not taste like the old school brands from my childhood
but the plastic around all of them broke eventually
i mean does this mean a writer can play an italian prostitute for shock value ? uh uh
what a disappointment this is after my great experience with the first two
it would be better if it had some sort of clip on it
however as the years went on when there was n't anything left of the book then suddenly all comes out ? not sure how realistic that is
but in each box i 've ended up giving away two of them
i will be buying a more durable cover since these do n't seem durable
i should have known better
i bought it for my mother and she loves it
but this one just went too far for me
but that 's no use now
do n't know whether it 's safe or not for steeping teas
to be honest i did n't read all the reviews on this and should have
you might be able to play games or listen to music without pain
this book is not good
not my idea of a good beginner book
but then again it 's free so i ca n't complain too much
perhaps i will even know how patterson gets around without driving
the first one leaked air while pumping and kept the bike upright
i got the first part free but would not recommend it to anyone for any reason unless you need some good stress relief from a book
i bought two of these for my daughter and her best friend as a birthday gift
too much gore for me it was n't just the gore but the fact that half way through she took it to extremes
my dad is in the military i 've heard plenty on how the military has no honor or integrity
the stories of her time in alaska were interesting but the writing style was not very appealing and it felt as though she did get the facts right
since then when we turn on the picture comes to life
this was one time where i got to skip through parts so i could actually focus on the current one
it was pretty predictable and a little too much to be believable
i loved this book until it just fell apart at the ends
the audio is staticy
mary after being traumatized by her experience is suddenly a perfect person who does n't want any help with her issues
and in my experience logitech is n't too great about their tech support
i bought this item in june because it offered a good deal on the price with super saver shipping after using this unit for 3 monthsand then one day would not turn onafter calling panasonic and waiting 20 minutes finally got someone who could understand english
i will stick with traditional southern cooking
these books were poorly written
after only having it for 2 months though it 's going completely kaput on me
a good general guide with great tips to teach training your dog how to behave in unfamiliar situations
the author says some people are sensitive so she has included many ways for her to eat without offending others
this method works wonderfully no need for any teabag
the only thing nice about this item is that its cheap
then today while plugged into one of these chargers about half way down it decided hey maybe this can do something after all
having read and thoroughly enjoyed the first instalment of this series i was expecting more excitement from this book along with several other elements associated with it ; however that does not appear to be happening
there must really have been some mistake made when creating this considering how it 's described as 4 large speakers
there is no way you will get the amount of blankets they 're claiming they claim you will get this company has cheated me and my wife out of $ 120
the writing is good but there 's not very much
this battery works great for the first few months and it gets me through one weekend shooting my son
had my unit for only a couple of months before it would not turn on
he suggested trying an adapter since it 's only about $ 15 but then says there are other models out there which claim to be compatible
i contacted customer service for technical support about this problem and after trying the tips off their website they said that there was nothing they could do besides send me another one
there are many books on the history of this war
this book is very informative with lots of information for beginners and anyone wishing to get into the world of raw food eating
in my opinion this movie would be so much better if they had left the original script alone
it looks really cheap and we had thought we were getting something classy
all of my dvds are now stuck together
it is now being sent back for repair
if you 're looking for a good romance novel read the mitford series
i wo n't recommend this recipe book for a newbie cook as there is very limited recipes
update after 3 months my cats ' latest purchase quit working also
we have used it now for several months still kinda uncomfortable to sit on though
but to those of us using our homes or homes as personal entertainment and business we will find the majority of suggestions i felt to be impractical unaffordable for most families not feasible i would n't think so much at $ 300 and frankly lacking common sense
a lot of frustration trying to get what i think is an amazing product
it has been the best chew so far and very durable
at first i thought it was my new kindle fire hd but realized that this cheap cord would not work in either device
this thing is too hard to get a capsule out of let alone open it
there are plenty of books out there about travel that cover these areas including fodor 's which is still one of their best
it definitely is not heavy duty
it does work fine but it is unusable because of quality
bob zmudzis new york city ny
it was a mistake to purchase this book on kindle
good thing it was cheap because if not i 'm not sure where i could recommend it
the first one worked on and off for many weeks
it also got me thinking about the things i did n't think of when trying to get my home organized before a move
i tried them out when they arrived but not for long
for the price they will do just fine for infrequent use so long as you are n't planning on filling the bag all the way
it is good to know that the real star trek will be getting back on the air again in may with new episodes of tng
it used to take 15 20 minutes to access the internet very frustrating i 'm going back to old reliable linksys rating 1
i checked my cable box and all was working but when we switched to the same tv the picture went bad again
it was only about 6 tall
the author spends quite some time on her medical condition and how it affects others yet there is n't much at all about being pregnant or taking care in general for babies
he had just stolen her away from her father in order to get a bride
maybe better for teenagers though
we could have gone ahead & just used an expensive sock at christmas time
there are times that i wanted to pull out my hair at how ignorant the characters are
its bad enough they had to kill someone
she does change but it 's not exciting
it 's clear there will follow many such books where not much happens in each chapter until an ' unexpected ' event occurs at some point
i received no email from you about the package or when my order will arrive ? and also what would like you to do ? the delivery time it 's estimated for march 11 and that is 3 weeks since your first email
i have used a pair of these in the past and they were great so when this batch stopped working after about 30 days was too much for me not to mention that i am now left without any headphones while waiting on them thanks amazon ? you are always awesome with shipping times
i bought this novella because i 'd forgotten all about it
i will see how much time and energy i 've wasted but i 'm afraid they will fall apart before too long
if you buy them and you listen loudly which can be uncomfortable depending on your ears try using different ear buds and see how much better they sound
if that were n't bad enough how long do we have to endure the incessant complaining throughout this ? you see everyone in these lives has either suffered one terrible injury at some point during their youth or perhaps several
i did not finish this so that proves it was n't worth reading
do n't get me wrong its better than other books just wish this one would have had some interesting recipes
the base was cracked
this player will not work with panasonic dmrea7 without buying several adapters for the tv comes in box to fit tv
contacted netgear support who first told us a firmware update might unlock it
my first one showed up without a charging cord
at least that 's what they said
you just want to know what 's going on
it has some steamy scenes which i do n't feel were necessary
my husband bought this for me as a stocking stuffer to replace one i lost on vacation
i did n't realize this until i received them
there does seem to be interesting information but it 's buried under a pile of jargon and obscure words
we were in our early teens
also its larger capacity does n't allow for as much papers to go through at once even though it says it 's a 9 sheet maximum shredding so you will need some of those smaller shredded pieces first
even though i was very upset in the end they refunded me fully
they are just barely usable as erasers but nothing more
it sucks first its too big but now i look at it it 's way to short after that if you want something like that go for it
it 's not even worth $ 2 because you will be breaking the connector soon
only complaint is that it got gross from water residue on it
also there are parts in the middle where some really terrible things were going on such as when he kills 2 people even though it 's not his fault everyone is looking at him strange for it etc
the information may be helpful depending on your goals or how quickly you read through it
only good thing i can say is she could run through it
i was a little disappointed with the art of seduction after reading it the first time
this product is terrible
just another computer game
there 's also lots of other stuff going on including magic do n't worry the characters have n't developed powers or anything just an unexplained ability since they ca n't feel magic monsters aliens etc
they are nice earphones but the volume is poor
i noticed this at least with this one
the third black cartridge is supposed to be just for printing labels but it lasted me about three weeks before fading away
battery charge last very long for its size
the book is n't what we thought it was
this is a nice enough little mouse for my small laptop but there are two things i was n't prepared for
its a terrible cd just listen to some other artist
not much happens in the entire plot it 's to short and not nearly as interesting
not that it could be called a fragrance because that 's just for marketing purposes
what junk from apple
also got dirty / sticky looking quickly
the mount did not come with my shipment and one of the binoculars had been broken internally
please do n't be led astray by the reviewers
especially becuase of my fave band the goo goos
i 'm really sorry about that considering how much fun they are
it looks nice feels sturdy but i am very disappointed since this is n't necessarily just me being picky which is why i 'm rating with 1 star instead of 2
moreover although the volume of my mp3 player is plenty loudway too loud if your music sounds like rap to begin with ? these headphones do n't produce enough bassand then only at an inaudible volume
so as it states in the description this product stopped working within a day
as for me buying it no
the thing is most other bluetooth headphones are crap
also the heroine kind of got on my nerves ; she seemed so naive & naive
the audio just cuts out
thank you for letting me read your books mary j mary_jo
my biggest complaint is that when a woman marries an american she does n't feel her husband has any say one way or another over his job
the old model was excellent and i bought two
the one thing that was not described in any detail about what it actually included was you must have an additional hdmi cable
the concept is great it was easy to set up and start printing from both pcs on the other side of one network cable but that just about all there is
she said later there felt like something heavy inside rubbing against her legs
we have tried many different methods of copying it most including burning the book
you would think amazon / usa would n't sell this
at first glance they appear reasonably well made
i do need to add more information and will be updating this review after some use
i bought this cable because the specs on its amazon page say it supports 1080 p and all other specifications for their hdmi cables
the charging light stayed lit but none of the plus and minus indicators would come on
that 's how much nikon owes me
this item is very nice looking and matches my bathroom perfectly
while it does have some helpful info for the most part i found myself skipping ahead because of lack of space and page numbers
the fabric is stiff as hell save your money
i had a hard time understanding whats going on with him
it looked nothing as shown in picture
it 's quite comfy considering it keeps my butt warm
this book was not so good i love a good series but
just not interesting enough to read any more
after one week or so there was no signal at all when connecting via either hdmi or usb
80 i decided not to return anything
it will make for great reference but not good as actual carry book
you will be sorely disappointed if you 're hoping for something with some excitement or new plot twist
so he jumped right thru
while it 's cheap compared to buying one directly from pny or other companies there are many less expensive alternatives that will work just as fast
a nice story just lacked some details between characters that would make the book so much better
when they were received some of the dishes had chipped around one rim
and there are many more studies showing how violent they are which does n't fit into the story here
i really thought there was a new chapter coming in this one
i bought this camera a year ago at the recommendation of a friend
they came in very small packaging ; all four corners bent or torn
and after about 10 or 20 listens there are no memorable parts at all where this would be particularly enjoyable
i am surprised that most other reviews said how good books 14 are
do not buy any of panasonics products
this is why i only gave 4 stars instead of 5
does not heat at all
i 'm not even sure if it 's a right one as they are all packaged up
to add insult to injury it takes about 68 weeks before my payment gets approved on line
will buy next book in the series
however they did n't seem to cover very much in depth
no more buying plastic ones
i still play it when i'm bored but its not my favorite rpg because it 's almost impossible even the level 1 boss is insanely hard you can win only by being lucky
this is one of the worst tools i have ever bought and they sell it for $ 16
the dvd was in terrible condition
it did not work and i had to return it which cost me additional $ 20
when you run the vacuum over his ear it sounds like i 'm blowing on a can because he coughs so hard
everything seemed forced and unrealistic
this product is crap
but it is a love story
this review is directed towards the author
there must be some rules of proper punctuation on these things
just not powerful enough for me
also because there are few photographs in the book this does cause some problems for me
it did come in good time / condition but only two of them worked which i found to be disappointing
great customer service except that part of this thing is garbage
recommend this seller & product with two thumbs up
my first read by this author
if there are any problems i 'm returning or if my phone is taken out of case
after 3 months you can only hear some of what 's going on around you but mostly background humming
so what ? you will all be dead any way
we have been waiting for weeks from amazon before we received it
it 's a nice coffee but very expensive for the amount you get
it fits nice on it
example i looked down at my watch and saw that it [ shows ] 509
waste of money
not so with this one
for one thing there is so much misinformation here that if you are reading thisit might not matter what i say
the story is very well written and has characters to care about
finally after about 10 minutes he decided just unplugged everything from the modem in one complete circuit then asked if there was still a light that indicated internet connectivity
scott managed some pretty major problems in her attempt and it was truly painful for me as reader
had to return it the back stand that you can rotate did n't stay upright it kept slipping down
if they had just put the entire movie on one cd it would be good as i have bought most of my movies from other sources
not only was this a waste of money but it did n't even work
otherwise do n't waste your time
this book is so basic
you will only waste a couple hours of your life reading this
love her books characters humor writing everything
it 's really nothing like the tv show
i also find it hard to imagine any guy actually wanting or even willing to sacrifice all these years in the spotlight and go back home every week
for example when asked to print a test page all it would do was feed back blank pages into the copier until unplugged then replug every time
i used to think that sony vaio were the best laptops but with this model we seem not so
it would have been greatly improved if there was color to it please update your ebooks with color
like any diet these pills will affect you differently than one who is already into a healthy lifestyle
only good thing about it are the many colors available
for me just a good product
i 'm very disappointed because when they say used then you know it
also when you plug it in there is a sound coming out of it
very flimsy material and did n't stay on
the writing is horrible ; the acting was bad ; overall it made me want some of them back from my nightmares
sorry but have sent emails and left notes but still no response from them
not much of a plot just lots of sex
only problem is it does not fit my 2011 jeep cherokee
a waste of time i only finished it because i paid money for it so that tells you how much i'd like to get rid of it you know who done it ? do n't read it
the other books by john robbins that i 've read are much more informative and have far better illustrations and informative
the author is doing what too many scientists do in these genres creating a book for some large corporate publisher who needs to meet an ambitious sales goal from chapter 1
not as our choice but we could read about 2/3 or 3/4 way thru before moving on
not happy with them
thanks love it hope you love reading to
the music is great it 's totally different and funky
it will just randomly decide that it 's not going to do anything until you turn off power to it
the first three albums were incredible but i found the sound started sounding overproduced to me in this recording
the product was as described however when i opened the package only a small portion of each earring actually had gems on them i would love to try this set again and see if my third time around will be better
i was intrigued when i saw this product thinking of a way to get the little dogs out of my house
not cool in hot weather /
do n't buy this product if you 're a photographer or for any professional do yourself a favor and look at the positive reviews
i do n't know about the other reviewers but my original did n't last much less than 6 years
i 'm upset because i loved this cover
the problem with this download was that i could not get it to play on my computer
i used this camera for about a month
for example what had happened at home ? what about their future together or married ? who did what to whom ? too detailed of characters as well
i 'd like my money back
it has no substance at all
its very cheaply made in china
if you want more from christian fiction try reading books written by robert jordan
the light will come on but there is n't any power at all coming from it
no matter what his opinion is he comes off as being ignorant about pro football and the players and willing to accept nothing less than flawless greatness
in fact it 's difficult for me to read
sometimes my husband will go as far as putting them through dishwasher which results in him getting mad at me for being a selfish bitch lol but i will keep using them
very disapointing that amazon thinks you can sell junk
we bought the camera for the outdoor pictures and was not pleased with its performance but still would have given it a little more time
i had to apply 3 sets of pads and 4 different types of caulks
and there were a lot of places where i was hoping someone would break character & tell them things would n't work out so they could shut up
but it does take an awful lot to make me want to keep reading just because i have paid money to acquire said book
i wish they would of spend the money to add some kind of metal clips or hinges on them
i bought this so i could game more hours or have my wireless range extended
too many characters to keep track of too unbelivable plot too predictable ending
in fact if i try and use it at all while it 's connected i 'm only allowed a little more than 5 minutes of reception before the audio becomes unsynced
you will be throwing your money too
it just came apart inside his pocket
i feel that this book was way too short to start with and the ending was horrible
a few small bubbles
the smell is overpowering chemical like smell within an hour or so i 'm assuming they did n't seal well enough to prevent this
but then on day 3 the back cover completely broke off while putting in batteries that 's just not very good so far
the ending would be cool but do n't expect to reach it
there 's a huge amount of static
will keep searching for better ones that i 'm sure we will find
the author tried to fill in a little more history with some characters but still needed more
all in all i wish that the directors made this better then what they did but since that 's not possible oh well
if you are wondering about how this book reads to your child i would have to point out it is in extremely foul language not just one word or two but multiple times per page
i am an avid reader but i 'm ready for any book with decent writting and good characters
well worth what amazon has charged me so far
so maybe some work has already been done
it is hard not to feel that you are really missing things when you read this book and i would be more than willing on buying part 2 as there were some major ideas presented during certain stages of events
thought this book would offer practical tips from an expert too many long lists which do n't go into any concrete detail no photos either
do n't waste your money you will be sadly disappointed
i bought this book to help my son with his math trig
it 's almost seems like she got tired writing it or needed help getting her story going
also it is made of plastic so may be breakable if dropped
i've had puzzles where they never peeled off at all ; this one does
this item arrived with one speaker broken
in addition to austin powers it was good enough i 'd watch again
they need to get their act together and not rip off our money like this
the package says no negative side affects but i definitely did have some stomach discomfort
i have not installed yet but based on reviews this will hopefully be easy
they get easily distracted in conversations and do these things without thinking them through
i 'm not even going to bother writing a review
one thing that has always stuck me is how every writer whether a new author or an established author they are trying to prove something with their characters
not sure why but when it shows picture in vga mode tv wo n't show picture i have to change the source for picture resolution
i also think it 's funny that they do n't label them as doublesided
the case itself does add quite a bit of thickness to the phone but it 's also better than not having it at all without sacrificing anything else
i will not buy another from them
why ca n't they all work for one price instead of two prices ? it worked great when i purchased it so my rating does n't quite reflect quality because i 've only had it less than 6 months now
but he needs to take time off from writing one book a decade or even two before trying something new
i have tried multiple things including upgrading to an apple airport extreme router as per apple 's recommendation then using another computer connected directly via ethernet cable which is what i 've always used
and also did n't have even remote control or charger
no instructions how to what do you even do
in conclusion this is a very poor product if you want good quality get some over ear headphones from your local music store
with some effort and effort my camera attached quickly to it i used double stick tape but once in place not even an hour later the entire mount wobbled so much that everything i had just mounted hung down on one side
the cover came damaged in my pocket and there were pencil markings on it
it should read 100 simple ways to clean out your house
i 've never used it before it 's too complicated
i was looking for a movie that could get my kids to move up and down more than 10 steps every 3 minutes or so as they went through the various activities
maybe that 's just because they 're being edited but still
however after watching it with a group of friends on friday night there was n't much we could discuss other than how awful this was and that it 's still not funny
the way it is constructed gives support where they do n't belong and makes your neck curve away from the spine
the handle comes up so high that is really unstable
these did n't even last 2 months before i had to start repairing them
i 've ordered a second one
if you want a good book try reading gone girl or some stephen king
while being as easy to set up as this camera is suppose to be there are several annoying flaws that make this a useless product for me
the picture quality was n't even great at all
but the main problem is for some reason the disc does n't do well with our player which plays every other disc
the writing style was n't bad but the content felt like a pamphlet written more for those trying to understand what goes on when they get married
i bought this battery as a replacement for the original in my 2009 macbook
if i could go back i will save myself some money don't buy you will be disappointed
the item is uncomfortable and too loose to keep the pad in place
i have not purchased this item so i cannot review it
my beef is with this particular cover design
it works well and i have had no problems but if you are looking for dishcloth that dries off quickly this one will not satisfy you
it arrived on time which was great but when connected to the internet and trying to download some files most of them did not download a message came up that said the network cable or wifi connection could be interrupted by other processes such as ; downloading videos reading email etc
they do seem to have slightly better quality construction than ones i 've had before mostly for their pliers
did not really help with the odor and had a very strong smell that did not leave me wanting to use it again or purchase this product again
so if you 're wondering what other women think of mr
as a fan of the original and as an avid collector i was very happy with my purchase when it arrived
like others who were fooled by the photo and the cool looking logos do n't fall for this piece of crap
amazon should pull these products off their market they sold me one that did not work by default so its no wonder they do n't want it
it is so small when filled no wonder you can fit one egg or french toast on these things the description needs to have an option for measurements other than pounds when describing how many eggs will fit
there 's no opening at the bottom for easy access
if your looking for something cheap to just be tossed in your desk drawer then this product is n't too bad but as far as quality goes it 's poor
read the source material ; it 's better written more interesting and while less well known most likely has greater truth
way too lengthy and wordy was bored with the story
but it 's not enough to make up for such an overlong drawnout love story
it worked the first time i used it but after that there was a problem with it
its strong and chemicalsmelling
it 's not the first time i am on a mission to make better bread and have this book be helpful
maybe if you are really interested in seeing and hearing how men on a horse think you will find something helpful here
amazon offered this exact item
thank you judy p
so what 's wrong with that ? there is unfortunately * no* new material
it 's more about style
this book was recommended to me so i ordered it
if you like romantic suspense then this book should interest you
this was ordered for our new camper
what happened with water sweetened as well
the film was an accurate portrayal of the life changes for a young man who had to go from being successful and wealthy in his home country australia to becoming homeless before turning into a drug addict
unless you just want something lightweight and cheap
very disappointed especially since it cost so much
i am disappointed because the information contained inside this book would be very helpful to somebody who has never been out in public
it 's been several months since i 'd installed this junk and still using it
i bought this book to see if it was worth getting the hard cover because of its hefty selling price but now i will just keep checking books out at any bookstore for free or a low price
some of me found his experiences a little silly also
this cable is so hard to work with after 2 days i could not get it back together and was very disappointing i really expected something better
my son has not tried it out yet so i cannot speak from first hand experience
i 'm not exaggerating when i say this book is terrible
they still enjoyed it but i will be very careful buying this book that talks about how barbie 's dress was stained on her prom night
unfortunately it does not fit her laptop
there are better ones out there imo
just not what it 's meant for
i 'm not sure if i will be reading another dan brown book any time soon but i think some of his others just miss an opportunity to create excitement
so i returned this
it was n't as good tasting either
it was too short so by adjusting with another piece of velcro i can tie up
the book should be called my house was not worth what they sell now it 's full of generalities so people are deceived by all of these experts
after reading other reviews i cannot seem to make my computer recognize it
the section on going nuts is not only interesting but eyeopening
and while it was n't anything that detracted from our enjoyment of them it made sense that they would be written at different paces than real people speak
not happy about it at all but when you pay what i did for how can expect the quality they deserve
and although it lasted over three years
i bought this because of all the great reviews
do not buy until they take note about this
as one reviewer stated the book needed some major editing
maybe if you have one very light bright colored nail you will think it 's okay otherwise take your chances elsewhere
while she discusses in the book other aspects of being a writer how writers should write and what writing is about there was no discussion about story construction
this is a good book i enjoyed reading it and the end was different from what you would expect
for decades disney has been pumping out classic animated features that are a pleasure to watch over the holidays
what else do they have ?
i also agree with everybody elses negative feedback
it looks like the strap will scratch easily one of them already has an indentation from it
how can you make a mistake that is so obvious ? if only amazon was doing more research
at least if i had gotten an actual yoga instruction book rather than this crap i 'd know what i 'm doing before spending money on this garbage
the battery barely stays on charge for more than one room
i can only read about 10 % of one book and sometimes it is hard to go back in time
like some others just does n't hold up
they wo n't ship without it costing me more to return
at first maybe it was because these are n't hard boiled eggs but by the 3rd time we made them none seemed fresh
my guests were still able to see through their curtains the ones that worked are great
the idea seems good
very disapponted in this book
save your money or just download it
if you can get used to this then it 's fine
i was disappointed with this product
it did however provide about 5 more at most percent increase in run time
received my replacement thinking mine might be defective since its been refurbished for me
it felt like it had been translated from an english language and that there were several grammar mistakes
but then you read it
overall you can go elsewhere if you 're looking for quality
like the other reviewer ; i 'd like to say that i thought this was a funny book
they are not 1500 thread count but feel like regular cotton
but being on a really great car with no heat this is what worked for me
there are better designs out there
she must be suffering from a mental illness
did not get a receipt in the package
i have received a faulty item ; it was not working
buy something at walmart or kmart ; even if its on clearance spend more and expect better
i have seen many many good reviews on here and it seems like everyone loves this book so i feel bad for the 5 star reviewers who say that they just want their money back
they split open immediately leaving holes and causing them not be usable
the concept is wonderful and i can see how this would work well except for the fact that it just does not have enough power
maybe it 's my system but i 've experienced the same problems others have
this product does not work very well
it 's written in a very difficult format and requires the reader to read several paragraphs before you get any sense of anything happening until then
i received it in no time at all
i 've always respected his writing skill having read all of his books several times
well after trying mine i know exactly why it 's junk
i thought this book would be a short summary for those of us who are fans or curious
i use it regularly to get my oil changed but the screw on cap does n't fit tight so when you turn it a lot of the stuff comes out
purchased through amazon with prime did not get in in a timely manner
this particular box is not very good
also if you 're looking into it just as a case this is n't your best choice
do not waste your money and i ca n't make a return on amazon
my dog was terrified of this thing although i think she would not have been if i had just put it on her
if i would 've have known that this was a book written by someone who actually used the word f*cking i 'd never purchased it
this item was much too hard to use
amazon should review the products they sell on their shelvesbefore shipping
the metal parts just broke off
i am currently returning this item as it will not register with either my mac computer or macbook air and there is no tech support
do n't order these without knowing your regular size then go down in sizes
i will buy from another manufacturer
a little too much sexual tension but good writing and interesting plot twists
i 've read much better stories on the subject and for free
good game at first however it has gotten so hard that my son got fed up playing it
as other reviews mentioned you have to slide your cover in and out
but you would n't be writing a book about her
what great insight you tell how to travel at 4 am
i wish amazon would stop selling this type of book or even try to make it available on the public library shelves
i received my package in a timely fashion and everything that came with it seemed to work as intended however they did not last long at all
i replaced this one with an old linksys no problems
it sounds like a woman has written it or did research based on hearsay stories
the pages also arrived bent
it worked well and kept things warm enough
for a cheap price you get what you pay for
my kids liked reading it and asked us to read chapter 4
the tip of this stylus is extremely flimsy and bends easily
their father tells them if they do n't do something like this they will never be a happy family
this would be ideal if we had just a small room but when it runs at night on continuous volume for our sons bed we 're too tired to fiddle with it
james is also going to charge people $ 2
but the batteries that came with it were used when we opened them i wanted a new one so this is n't too much of a problem
this book is a joke and an embarrassment to the good sense of our president
it seems as though the whole kidnapping and it 's connection with what is happening at the time has not even been addressed
if you 're interested in finding out how it 's suppose to end up do n't let your preconceptions keep you from watching it
this is the second time in 2 years that i have been unable to enjoy a christmas dvd
my wife got me a sony hdrsr5 as a gift from my inlaws
there are no recipes in this cook book just general ingredients like canned soup and eggs
it 's hard to read and find the good parts
when i started it up the screen came back and said that laptop adaptor does not recongize device
if that 's you then by all means
the camera comes with windows xp ; however you need to install an application called dlinkview in order to operate on wireless
it 's sad as well that it is n't a true crime like it should be but an unknown author just slapped her name on something
they 're much tinier than that
i only played this a few minutes before going to play another game
first of all it 's really small but that 's better than no coverage at all
the item arrived quickly but the picture showed an apple plug on it when in fact there was some kind of miniusb
amazon sent me the next one quickly but after 2 hours on christmas day we are still not working correctly
i have used this book in my classroom for about 2 years and have never been able to get it back
first off if you are looking for a story that really draws on and builds upon all the great vampire lore you 've ever read then go ahead and skip this book
did not fit my phone sent back
she likes to put some kind of treat in it
this was one of about four books in our library last year for a book club discussion
anyway i will be selling it
i purchased these cables for the price
it 's almost like someone decided to end it which is sad since so many people said the ending made the entire book worth it
can only say at first glance there are many other books that are similar to this
you may have better luck
the plot is about an unknown character who goes on to be one of the doctor 's ? enemiesand then comes under his control and proceeds with his plans
this person can not even explain how or what he does
it 's funny because there was none like puff daddy when he first came out but then what happen to him
this dvd is n't worth your time or money very few songs no story line
my mother bought these for my son last year
her father is dead why not let her know do n't torture her take her
i do a lot of baking and this just does not work for me
the whole series was very depressing with no clear ending just left you hanging hoping there would be more information in future books
one thing that surprised me about this book is how it 's a sequel
unfortunately it was not only messy to mix these with wet food they absolutely refused it
i 've tried a few of the healthier / cheaper brands and thought i was getting a good bargain
the recipes in this book were simply terrible
after 4 months of light use ~ 6 hours this item started acting up
my daughter and i had to send the item back
they are pretty big
when applying make sure your screen is clean
we bought this unit to keep ants out if our shop in a very dry climate
if anything it 's almost inedible
the lids of course will not fit the largest pot but you can use your own not sure if they gave an updated recipe list with it ? the utensils are okay
i think the price should have been $ 4
when you hear it you will understand
my experience with ordering and receiving books from amazon has been satisfactory
if you do n't believe me try it
also if you plan on putting more than 2 coats of paint / sealant they do n't give enough strength which is frustrating because i have no idea what they will do when it 's drying
it was mostly a review but did n't really give me any ideas of how to organize and put things away
i love this series however the last installment was very disappointing
if you dont want ur hair wet during shower this will be perfect product
i use my kindle daily
but after 1 week of wear they turned yellow on the toe part
the pump does n't work well and you have to constantly shake it until its done brewing
i cannot believe that amazon continues to sell such junk on their website this item deserves negative stars
tried again later in the day which ended up being another full day of shooting without having time for recharging
when this game comes out i wo n't play it until everyone is ready at least have a chance to talk and get their say
he has written many
nice as a decoration though
you just want something light entertaining and fluffy and it does deliver on that premise
the story takes place during world war i
it actually took about 20 tries before i managed to finally figure how to get started
if it continues to perform as well in future i will be happy
my sony tv has great video quality but this camera is totally worthless
the writing is very simplistic with stilted dialog poor character development no suspense or surprise in solving the case except for one very minor twist near the end just more gratuitous violence
the old versions were better
there are several that claim to be the art of persuasion or some other title but they all say the same thing
and where is a good ending
it works well when you get it to work
i love all the features of this watch and that 's why i 'm rating it 2 stars but mine has suffered intermittent problems with freezing up since day 1
the author did a great job using interesting and new vocabulary which can be difficult on such a short book but as other commenterrs have said the story was really just lacking any depth
this little device is n't really well designed overall
the cord was not compatible i had to send it back but before that i ordered a new charger
it does have enough color variation that it works but the price was n't real cheap
i use this on an old dell
just a lot of talk
i love to take in new ideas especially if they are well written
first the connection became very loose and would not allow me to turn off or on without holding down its button
the story is told from two points of view one was my mother who lived before they started moving house when she was16 and then later another girl who lives at home
if you 've never read any of these books do it
not all recipies are included
this is a very expensive book for what you get
oh yes she can sing well i am glad but
you ca n't take either pictures
i tried this to charge my new kindle fire hd
my disappointment came when the pictures were taken using only manual settings
that also created problems
not sure if this is how it is as my account was charged last week and i do n't yet recieve any product
i do n't know what he was doing when putting together this book but after 30 plus years in public service there are so much more that could and should be added
you get what you pay for with the pricing and this item was below my expectations
this is my first mp3 player and although i 'm a nontechnical guy retired lawyer it 's not easy to operate with all these buttons on it
then when a person calls my phone 's voice mail message gets cut off for some mysterious reason
my next step will probably go with links
it 's super small so it 's really a hassle to even fit things into it
this is a review written by my 12 year old daughter for her science experiment
it charges when i 'm right next to it
go for another brand this is my first and last time buying linksys
in addition if you decide you do n't like it make sure there is something else on your to be read list
i got it on sale and it 's a nice looking machine but the only option now is digital audio
not happy with this just wish amazon would carry it
he loves them especially watering pipesa big hit with both his 2
and when it came 2 screws were missing
but if someone wants you then pay them
now it is no way to go
the only thing it is good for ? like another user wrote about they can say you have to remove a certain amount of hair when taking pills etc
9inch touch screen laptop and needed a case
i like these little bags because of their size and ease to use but my dogs did not
on top of that all the buttons stopped working so i ca n't change channels from within it
this guy can write
for example she says that after india conquered persia around 800 bc it tried to maintain a hindu temple and keep zoroastrianism out of india
it also covers his ears i will say that the seller shipped it quick and had a speedy delivery just not what was described
i enjoyed this book at the beginning of my reading of it
the book is so great great book loved it just wish i did n't pay $ 10 that you guys are getting for it
it does not work for either my computer or blueray player
seller refunded product price
i 've read half of this book and i 'm not motivated to finish it
while reading this i had to keep reminding myself how the author created these characters
but i will try my best in looking for another
there are multiple grammar mistakes in the first few chapters / paragraphs ; also many misspellings
after testing it out i found it 's even quieter than without mic
i think amazon has some type of problem with this because there are several other customers complaints about this
but then again i 'm a pretty tough critic
i purchased this item for my son for christmas
then this is one of many items going to china
and i really did n't like how everything tied back up so nicely at the end
this is a terrible product with no value whatsoever to me
some facts are interesting some not so but it covers the topics well
this product does not come with a charger
this is like a short story with no real plot very slow moving plotnot worth your time
you can load your usb drives however but then you can only hear what has been on these external drives
the material around the rim started to fall off after 1 day
if your into bad music then dont buy it
when i received it there was only the screen protector and not even that much on it
the medium sized muzzle looks like it 's for little dogs only
the first review stated this book is good
just was n't much excitement for me
this is my 4th or 5th capresso kettle
not sure i will continue this series unfortunately
i really have to wonder why mr
this was ok for an easy quick light read
this book was awful
when the item actually arrived it seemed to me that only half of the pieces fit
this movie should have been rated an r
now some how i will probably return mine
ashley 's newest recording the lost symphony is proving too difficult for me
not sure if it is from the different colors or manufacturing
it 's not as comfortable when it 's hanging from the wrist like that
i found this to be disappointing
do n't waste your money like i did on this thing invest in something with more quality
a little too wordy for a book marketed as a teen romance
not sure if i 'd read further by this author since there does n't seem to be a hint that she has more stories in her
the first cd came in as good condition
maybe it 's better for experienced people they can probably get more out of this than an average person would
i was looking for an inexpensive way to connect my computer with a hard drive but after reading the reviews on amazon i decided that going cheap might actually be worse considering this is only $ 20
the first two were under $ 100 but a little over half that price on this
it may be fine if they replace the entire order but since one jar does n't seem full i 'm afraid it might be broken by now
i do n't know if the device is defective but it did n't seem to work
no it 's just that i felt so sorry during some parts especially towards the end where we see all of these young people who are trying to be good christians without any real guidance from their parents or even church leaders try to make things right with god while everyone around them seems totally hopeless
do n't bother renting this movie buy it
if you were interested enough to want her back after she broke things off with him you could n't tell yourself otherwise
this book is a waste of money
my computer monitor shows them but the program never displays them
if you do n't know who they are this will make your life easier
i could n't even get through half of the book before i had to put it down
most if this stuff has been around forever
not what i expected but it had a positive twist
as soon as i installed this screen protector dust began to collect beneath the screen
in addition as another reviewer mentioned at times it jumped around a bit
good acting but a poor script
if you 're going to purchase one pair in your life time make it this
the cover came broken
we plugged in the charger again thinking maybe we did n't give it enough time or something as several friends had done
i bought this as we needed something that would work over our wood table for a small tv set
i bought two of these from e bay
this was n't as useful for me as others had told me
but i cant fault them for that
first there were so many grammatical errors in the first few pages i thought i 'd have to stop reading before i got halfway through
the case is cheap and does n't hold my items good
the sex scenes in the storyline were interesting but that did n't make up for all of it
did n't like this one much
i got this when my son was just a couple months old
it 's hard to figure out by sight which way the front of the case should be facing
it takes hours to make one level no kidding
so if you wanted another book to go along with your journals and there are n't many out there then get these crafts
with the transmitter plugged in it kept trying to work and never let go
interesting historical details and i agree that it 's hard not to wonder at some moments what could possibly happen next
at its best it 's pretty much impossible to control anything
my mom has done most of her tvs also
my advice go buy something else
if you are dealing with a wireless network one would think cisco 's author could offer some guidance for implementation
it is the worst thing i have ever bought in amazon
it does sound better in that they got to be themselves rather than try too hard just good old rock music
i 'm going to contact amazon maybe they will fix their listing ? if they ca n't fix this i will just buy them all at once
very expensive and no way to reorder since they 're made overseas
then came a few short months later
first off there is no way anyone over 5 ' 10 could comfortably stand up or touch their feet on the floor
bought this for my 12 year old grandchild who is very hard on the stuff she uses and it 's not a good choiceit was only two weeks when her little hand came to rest against an inside cover while i put in away something else
the plot is shallow and one dimensioned
definitely do not recommend
and now i know why
the author thinks his audience consists of people who have no idea what authenticity is
if memory serves me all older laptops are compatible with new ones when you buy brand new
it would be just what i wanted however if it 'd lasted longer than 2 weeks
how do you have your customers confused about what they ordered ? a 2 disc set the movie was listed as new
it might be useful if you 've forgotten how things tasted which is rare as far as memory goes
first it 's not so much a book as it 's an advert ; the author appears in a small piece of paper at front and back and quotes from books websites etc
this thing must fit very tightly around his neck
just as good quality for less than 5 bucks my daughter loves it tho and i 'm more inclined to give this guy another one
it broke within 5 minutes of her receiving it
but we ca n't listen to it so it 's useless
i gave a 2 star to this book because i did n't realize it was n't going in depth enough there are books like that out their on the market just not as good
if your planning on giving this case it 's daily beatings you will be replacing sooner rather than late
this review pertains to a perfect matter
there are some great concepts in here
i 'm thinking about buying the other unit
my dog went to me while spraying and had what looked like an accident under one ear
there is n't enough info in here
the other book by this same name has an almost equal amount of sex and violence but much better character development
there are several other books which continue this story but i have n't bothered to read them so you can tell that my opinion is n't worth any more than that
as for the romance though very short of being instalovious had enough depth that you believed it
should be avoided at any cost
too bad they could n't get something else for the gameboy
when this book first came out i bought it but did n't read it then due to a hectic life
it was fun trying out different actors
or better yet do n't
if anything she appears more ignorant than insightful
they were n't even wrapped and then put into an envolope so that when they were open there was one disc stuck to another
save your money buy somewhere else
i thought this was an album of old american folk music
they set it up for me and checked it
how can someone rate something so poorly ? the story is extremely thin and predictable
you can turn the light on but there are no indications of when you will have come out from behind the wall and what time zone or day your in
they also make no sense
too bad they ca n't do better on their filter
most areas seem poorly laid out or very vague which makes finding answers difficult
i have to believe this book got very good reviews and just never seems to go anywhere
i am a big james bond fan and have been with connery since his debut as james bond
i ordered this book for my granddaughter who loves horses
i will begin with the disclaimer in no particular order this is not a criticism of anyone who plays music
then about 10 minutes into my ride it completely stopped working
it 's a simple looking case but does very little else for my device
it would be nice if there were
even some one as successful a writer for young adults like janet evanovich has no idea what would make their stories even remotely realistic
when i receive it there could be lots of scratches on the front cover and / or back cover
this was actually a pretty decent book until about half way through
this is a very cute book
the dialogue is cheesy and they do try to add some humor think napoleon dynamite but when you 've seen so many scary movies with a similar plotline it 's hard not to get bored
it 's like reading about an accident and seeing all those pictures from later investigation
i 'm happy to say that i was able to put this cabinet together without help but for the following reasons 1 the predrilled holes were not aligned properly and the screw did not fit so i had to move a couple of pieces
my wife and i use this to record our tv shows at a recording time of 8 pm ; however the first night on christmas we had trouble recording
i have written other review on amazon and they told me to go back and read them first that was really nice of them
i received this book not wanting to think about how much more they should charge for these books if i bought them in paperback over paperback
after sending my product in for repair nikon claimed they could n't find it
if we could give negative stars in apple 's rating they would deserve it
i gave up trying to play together with him
they had to pawn several cars they owned to pay for it
you might think that the size of it refers to quality but there is n't any
i read it all but finally found myself frustrated at the end and had to do some looking up details related to these murders just so that i would n't have wasted my time
i 'm sure someone would be able to read this but there will never come a time when i will buy her books unless i can find corrections in them
even when it came down to kissing and making up every time someone said something funny you had to wonder aloud if they were kidding
it 's difficult to find a casual work shoe that does n't have too high of an ankle cut and this one does nicely
do not waste your time or money on this
but you get what u pay for
it 's just the first chapter of the whole book
if so may be i will pass
i bought this as well one of the belkin n150 bluetooth wireless travel mouse with nano receiverfor my i pad2
perhaps it was just that their self healing technology was n't strong enough
this is just ok as most cheap movies go
all in all it does what it 's supposed to
i cannot tell you what the quality is
the installation was fine until all of a sudden the picture had gone out
it 's ok but could look better
they still work but are really cheap
the edges were not rolled properly so every piece looks ragged like it came off a roll
i bought it because of it 's large zoom as my 8 year old needed to learn photography
also the water tastes awful in my opinion too
i 'm sorry to have bought it
one can easily do better for free at google images / photobucket
there are too many other remotes out there for kids who need this type of thing pay more for something with actual quality
there were no instructions in package
it is obvious at many points but then again no one can be expected to pay attention too well
the first time i used it in the camera half of the photos were blurry
i believe that some ideas are better off not being mentioned than added to make them sound like magic
amazon did n't help much
just going back to ordering other types online
no more than a placebo effect i could feel
this book has been around for some time and i just ordered it last week
it came on time but it is so small as mentioned in other review i thought i 'm getting a table top coffee table not only for the price paid
do n't waste your money try some other brand
if you do n't feel the need to research all of these questions online save your money
as much as i wanted to like this ended up in sending back because its not a good fit i think that 's my ear and i had some issues hearing people talk
first impressions i received the new york times illustrated book in hardcover edition as a gift
it 's already broken after three weeks
finally it takes twice as much battery power to change songs because it does n't register your touch
the only thing new here i found useful were many lists and references to other books written by her
the volume is hard to hear at night
i have n't used it yet because i purchased this to make baby food for my baby
or hours you do n't get any payoff at all
they read more like gossip columns
i would n't waste your money on this one
i was looking for a nice new book to read to my children the illustrations are cute and story line is simple but cute
i really like the design and it is a great size to keep in my purses
if you buy this be sure you 're getting something that works
for a book supposedly aimed towards young adults the language is quite harsh and unrelenting
i have been using this same model for several years
do n't waste your time with this product
there is no information on what kind of charger comes with it
and it should be comfortable enough
i returned them since there was no way i 'd want another pair if they even remotely resembled what i saw
the way things worked out between tristan & gwen was n't credible like many other books do
they are way too flimsy that they could snap anything just picking them up
in particular this book is n't very well written as the author has tried to convey emotion with words and phrases instead of actually having an actual character
i love the product but it comes with a label that was very difficult to remove
most other cds from her earlier albums do n't seem so strange though
this really needs improvement
it 's like one big chapter out of a bigger story
it makes sounds but when you press down on it there are very loud squeaks and clicks
now i 'm looking for something similar that will last longer
my krups krp300 hd finally wore out after 7 years of daily use 5 hours brewing time although we 've enjoyed it
the plug was difficult and came out often
my husband purchased it he has been a long time chef and said that this would be perfect
oh she 's got those skills
then one day there was no sound from either side
i had no idea there were so many different views on how to manage a white girl of black parents
i was dissappointed because the booklet showed a different cover than that in thead and also had information not mentioned by my kindle store booklet for kindle
this is truly an album that defies description
i 've uploaded two photos of what you are getting
the content itself seems like a wonderful insight into an interesting time in history but there are too many
to those who want more out of life here 's my short list of suggestions 1
they lasted only two to three months but were quite a bit cheaper than an oem bulb
they only suggested that it might have problems with interference
do n't waste your money or time with this cover
this is a good movie to view with your children
i was expecting some new information but it seems like just another self help guroute who thinks he can make someone rich or famous by selling stuff you already have
but other than that ? not worth reading
i bought it based on it 's high rating by other users in here and was disappointed
i am shocked at the number of glowing reviews for this book
she is one artist i can count on to produce great music her music always sounds like it should
on other pages though there were only two or three short paragraphs per page with no big blocks at all
my advice do n't take too seriously the grammar mistakes just go for it because of the interesting plot
it left me wondering whether or not i 'm reading one series set at various points over several hundred years with similar characters so i 'd know which brother she belongs to
you 've really lost me
most companies do n't currently run these businesses themselves let alone their employees
however it is n't perfect
still waiting on the third one
i do n't know what the deal is with this book but for me i think there should be some difference to say a girl and boy can share something in terms of sex boys have orgasms too or that if you watch porn it may just turn your child into well an adult
hopefully someone could do something because this was not very well made
will probably never order again
to be expected but since everything works great it 's easy enough once set up correctly
most children learn from the older kids
the book has a couple of decent chapters on the mechanics and procedures for implementing blockchain in an enterprise setting but most advice is really pretty basic
you are better off buying another brand
one thing was wrong with it that i could n't figure out at first
wish there was another option
this is a great product however it really needs help as my husband would have to be in the tub with me almost every time we took his temperature
we all know how lively p&p ; is
unfortunately it did n't work at all
there does n't seem to have been quality writing in the series as there were many grammatical and spelling errors throughout them
i went years and finally gave in when someone at the office encouraged me to try this product
first let me start by saying that i purchased this because it was a great idea and is fairly easy to set up
not that pleased with these at all
a friend of mine that had one has the same exact camera no matter how many time we tried to turn on flash exposure in settings nothing works
it is an easy step by step book
they light fine but do n't last long nor do the switches
i had stopped playing with them because everything else was okay
never again will i order products through amazon
this required an sd card and then the rest of the info came from a link in my kindle which meant having some web access for it
i've had 3 pc 's with windows xp or 2000 operating systems without any problems
you need some more meat there
we were very disappointed in our purchase so we returned it
the size is so small that it will go against my leg when i bend down to tie up a shoe
that 's why its free do not waste your time or money
save yourself some money by just using google
it has been several years since i 've lived that type of an life style yet it seemed like every other sentence which makes me think he went from being rich for the first few chapters down again to where he 'd be by the last chapter
it may interest them but probably wo n't
it takes longer to sweep up dirt from the floor
it 's about as bad as the beatles and rod stewart
i was disappointed in this
too small to get the job done
so far i 've got 1 tire up on it
very cute cover good for protecting the kindle in a carry bag
it tends to fall over on its own and is just awkward
but if you travel frequently as us or need something more practical like a car charger ; then do n't count on paying much at all using amazon
if you want an authentic italian model buy something else
if you have n't seen it rent it
this book does nottell alot about the real art of
but the second timeno longer fresh or great
one can certainly read this book once or twice ; otherwise i do n't advise it to anyone who wants an interesting read
they just had no sense at all when they knew things were going wrong
the battery was brand new
the epson has certainly meet the bill set up was easy enough but do n't fool yourself into thinking that scanning is as simple or fast as with your average allin one model it is n't
very cheaply made and broke the first time we used it
as someone who grew up reading comic books as a kid i thought it was great
dont waste your money it only cost me shipping to my house so its actually pretty cheap i suggest trying other types of soda instead
but if you 're looking for some good traditional music played in a modern context try a spirit gathering with various artists by don thompson on amazon uk
after ordering this i ordered a second one because one broke when opened
this album is at best nothing more than noise
the formatting is n't good either
i tried this with several different flavors of tea green tea chai and it does not work at all
so do n't lose the packaging so you can buy it locally
i purchased my first one and had to return it
not worth purchasing even when its being offered free
maybe they are putting out two copies and sending me back ? but it looks like one cover for both books so really ca n't tell what 's happened oh well
the first thing that i had to do was download their online player it took 3 hours and then the cd would n't play only a blank screen
scholls liquid foot pads
the characters were so shallow in earlier novels especially in the first where the author made us love them for all their warts despite being such whiny brats
i learned that it takes over $ 100 million dollars just to get enough junk through regulatory agencies before our national economy falls apart completely
this refurbished unit came from another vendor if you could somehow contact me i 'd like a replacement
the quality of the picture is not that great
hope they still make them
if you really value your money buy cds from elvis presley himself and stop buying albums with people who ca n't sing
the price on this one seems to be the best one
it reads like an outline of what probably could have happened before and how he should tie things together
however if you 're like me and would rather avoid things like surgery etc
sent back for an refund do not buy waste your time with this cheap junk amazon rocks ~ the price was too good to be true but you get what you pay for
they do n't feel as solid and substantial in the hand as real pens though
called tech support first was helpful but we had another person that said well i would think we have replaced everything out there so he just took his advice
it 's an ok game
i was disappointed when received it the item looks like something you might find at an antique store
bought this hoping to use it as a replacement for my hp power adapter that came with my acer aspire as57426845 15
this is a simple story like a christmas carol
my camera has never gotten hot during charging as other reviewers of different brands claim
but nothing here is earth shattering
the camera does display no pictures but says there were shots on it
do n't buy this if your phone is a 4s as i have one on my phone that has broken because i had someone try to glue some strips of tape around it
there is no interference and now the product has stopped working altogether
first of all this is a pretty cool product
the description sounded great there were parts of the story that took place in italy and other countries but seemed out of place
if not water would pool under pad so does n't absorb much anyway
if you are looking for detailed recipe info stay away
these also came in loose leaf form which may work better if you ’re going camping but when you have to steep it it ’s not as convenient as having brewed tea
i was so happy to finally be getting my hands on the books after waiting
it makes an irritating clicking noise when you open and close it i do n't think it works any faster than my 5 year old kodak
if you do n't then you will need to use your existing one
the language in the book could be improved by keeping quotation marks around things to cut out the flow
was not happy with product
no real option for moving and building things like we have with cities x ; i ca n't really imagine anyone being interested in that
for something at this price you can get a better product in walmart
i did not think it was challenging and the only thing good about this game are the graphics when playing with others
more like a short story
the language could have been better
but there was so much fluff unnecessary details descriptions of scenery the only thing you need is weather characters thinking about each other totally unbelievable dialogue for several pages at a time etc
would be great if you can put them in a window with no wind and move it every night for maybe an hour or so
now onto this keyboard
i guess when we buy something as inexpensive and seemingly low tech as this it is hard to be impressed a couple of the plastic ' prongs ' were broken on arrival although they are still functional
it 's boring and totally pointless
i could be wrong but the whole thing looks like a cheap counterfeit knock off of some kind
unless you want constant static and popping noises in your ear
easy to read screen
unfortunately there was too much bass especially when playing jazz
it 's so long and seems to be written in some academic language that 's hard even for the educated reader to comprehend
not all around great but okay
it is nice to have on hand for these unexpected situations
very small pieces that barely look like puppy doggie in reality
bought this shower curtain liner two weeks ago and the hem on one has already split open at one end
i can only give this product 2 stars since the battery on a pair of these flashlights different model just died one day
too many references to black women having had long lives that could have used more depth to explore these issues
it 's a great book but that wo n't load it loads like every other book
is it to show their support for some cause ? that 's just silly
this product may work good if you get lucky and buy it but i have gone through 4 of these over 2 years
i wish each one would get killed off so we can move on
i am not sure if this book was written by david baldacci or is his name and picture pasted in
i like the product and will probably use it for years
the description says this is for the x3 camera but it does not work with either my zs3 or v1
i will stick to buying good movies at blockbuster
the package clearly states assembly required since those two things cannot be done on their own
you can read a more detailed review on my blog [
i 'm sorry people ca n't get nutrition out there
on top of that there were n't enough vents at all in them
if you need anything over 600 threads count go somewhere with something worth paying for
this book is very well researched and written however i must say it lacks a true sense of romance
not good even boring as heck
this book was n't as good as the first one i read
on line it says remastered that would have meant digitally remastered or remastered
the pillow inside of was so hard that when you lay down your head felt like you 're on one side you just try again every time you turn over
these will work well in theory on their own or even together but they simply wo n't allow either speaker more than 2 ohms
there did n't seem like much glue inside the board to hold those pieces but since it fell off without breaking he 's too rough with everything he puts on it
this model is much more flimsy than the standard version
this is my first review but i 'm getting tired of wasting money buying products from ea games
i have been reading some good historical fiction so i 'm familiar with period names but there were many references made without adequate explanation
this girl literally had a one night stand 6 months ago
just got this book have read about half did n't really get anything from this book
this was my only concern
the whole reason for buying the book in my opinion really is n't because of the mystery
it 's nearly impossible for me care after a while where they end up or if anything really happens
the dialogue seems so unrealistic from the 1940 's that it makes me cringe it 's like i 'm reading some sort of 1950's play on stage where actors act as if they were speaking directly into the camera
but it lacks details
she is also incredibly powerful but she lacks any true sense of self let alone love
apparently they received similar results as i do
i 'd suggest you take a chance if your interested in finding out how things end up
i prefer to watch a film without sound
the product is advertised as a 3 pack even after i clicked on the link when looking at this
when finally completed i discovered that there were two more chapters missing
i've used this for nearly a month
now that i 've used them my opinion has changed
today i spoke with another customer service person after 5 hours on hold with them tonight because my tv seemed off
what killed me though was what is written on an amazon review called i was bored and skimmed through most of book after page hoping there would be more action between the two main characters
it made for a very frustrating experience
if you want something with more substance try one last time
i have only had it for 3 months
the product i recieved did n't work
first one went bad within a year in an unpowered environment
00 for this dvd it 's that bad
this book was really good i do n't think you will be disappointed
i am a high school teacher so this is not my typical genre
i bought it because i was interested in what he had to say on why and how his own father passed away from an unknown cause
i was only able to finish one chapter before moving on unable to wait another minute in order to do anything else
it was worth a try and would like an exchange or credit however that 's too much trouble i 'm sorry it 's just money down the drain
also there are several typos in it i 'm all against that crap and would n't buy another of these unless they fix it
i love amazon and it 's customer service
this is a great little machine and does make good coffee however i would caution anyone who wishes to have one for more than 2 years that the pot may burn out from normal use before you realize it
the product page and the picture are misleading
it was n't new the first time we went to use it my son spilled half of the bag over his lunchbox
i was very excited for this case
if you were interested in watching it do so on prime as i 'm not sure if there are any ads or not
after being returned amazon refunded me within 24 hrs
ca n't wait for book 5
also at least 3 of my daughters classes read this as part of 11th grade
otherwise i 'd keep looking
] overall poor performance
not once did this feel real or authentic
it works just as my other 3 did except one of the batteries is not working right
if you want cables that take 30 minutes each to put together your in good luck
my advice would have been to spend more money for something that did n't fall apart so quickly
my 16 year old daughter and her friends both dancers said that they thought i had recorded it from tv
the only thing about this book that made any sense was at what point does being a man automatically mean you are gay
it was also dirty when new so how can u expect me put on an invisible shield that 's suppose to fix these problems
it 's simply not possible that england could be attacked by 2 dozen nations in such a short period of time they would have found out about each other 's armies very quickly
but there was n't enough about each person their personalities background etc
now i will order new one directly from dell which has two year warranty and is working fine
after several hours of searching the online forums i was able to track down a way to get it connected wirelessly
it is clearly broken
it cost me more than half my money as the return shipping and handling fee to ups made no difference
the description said it would be correct fit
it seemed like she was telling more of the story than showing
after 2 or 3 months would n't turn on
that 's why i was disappointed by the book
it just did n't capture me even though i 've loved many of her books before
this was great while it lasted but apparently some thing went wrong with the electronics or wiring and it has been in for repair
looks great and functions great
third time it did not work as well still have yet to successfully vacuum my car
go with something more reliable
the ideas are wonderful to bring forward for discussion
batteries do n't hold charge just sit there blinking all night and that makes me really mad but you get what you pay for
not much suspense here
like most books lately there are way too many characters
my dog absolutely loves this toy the squeaker never lasts very long but she still continues to play with it as a squeaking toy
i 'm a huge fan of all the books listed in this compilation and found many excellent titles that either i had n't heard before or have n't seen before
all i found in here were several grammatical errors that any 6th grader could have caught and no substance
so naturally if you do buy this make sure that none of your items are accessible with these locks on them
i purchased this game based on a recommendation from another gamer who said he could n't turn it off but mine would not run at all with the video out
it 's good reading on an airplane or train
be aware of this this product is n't worth it
when i tried to open up the bag of coffee it leaked
in general do n't buy this
i have used several different brands of coconut oil over the years with great results so when my local natural food retailer started carrying it i decided at a certain point it 'd be worth trying it
i did n't care for the characters very much and found myself looking forward to some of their deaths
i will not buy it again there was no flavor in my chocolate drink
the plot has no twists and turns it 's just some ordinary folks going through the normal hardships that people go through
and one has some type a disease that makes her lose contact with people and forget she just came out if town
however all of the items were shipped very quickly
even after reading all instructions and making everything as exact as possible this did not make a tasty cookie
unfortunately these pots are not worth what they 're sold for
i bought the book used here on amazon it came wrapped in plastic inside and when i took out the tape to open it every page of all 12 was stuck together the cover has this weird wrinkly look from being folded up it appears used which is fine no scratches but like said before you never know what you 're going to receive
you are supposed to be able to attach a leash with two attachments but it uses only one so your dog ends up needing one for everything and if their collar has some reflective stuff on it you will have a very expensive useless collar
first off there exists no explanation about what or why these people have become vampires
i just want to read it on paper or in hardback version
but from me it 's going back
the drive will not be recognized on 2 different computers
the stories are great i am a fan so i decided to give the book only 2 stars but with this new edition there is no way that is acceptable
i love romantic mysteries but this one did n't quite do it for me
this product is not what it 's shown to be in the picture if i would have known it was going to take a long time for me to get it i would 'nt of ordered it now i 'm gonna go by my local hobby store and find an air brush
at first i thought maybe its the lighter socket that 's not working properly so i just used pliers to move around or tug at different areas but now neither plug locks into place anymore
although published in 2000 i was informed by an author who knows much more than he admits is true about some aspects of publishing and marketing
not only did mine arrived broken i also found out after i opened it that it does n't come in a pack of 100 filters as advertised by amazon
there were people running around and no sense of realism
if you think about the book by looking at its cover it looks a lotbetter than in reality
broke within two weeks
we have several of this brand and they all feel like cheaply engineered plastic junk
what happened to her husband and his son ? the only reason why these two were together is because he loved her
this is really a bad product for dogs
if i could have chosen zero stars i would have
as with several other reviewers i did receive a product that appears exactly as pictured above but the unit i received does not look like any sort of air pump at all
guess they just ca n't type ?? not sure why
it 's just a cheap case that wo n't protect your i pod screen
there were only 10 recipes that we would make when it comes to using this cooker
these headphones feel and sound cheap
skip this book it 's garbage
this seems like an extremely expensive book
do n't want to burn my fingers by tipping this pot on it if you 're pouring quickly enough
*** update the customer service has been very nice they sent me an extension for free shipment of another one
one of the worst examples of political incorrectness
had to spend hours online researching laptops which support xp / vista & windows
where were you when the lights came on ? sweet carol with an organ accompaniment is completely different
it was more like getting an idea then anything else
i think that most of these socalled tips had nothing new to offer me
the final result looks awful but cannot be sanded with all of that glue
when you hit buy it says ship within x days
] before buying their books
i am very glad the authors published this book however do n't believe it
some scenes were n't all together
first you give us an intriguing set up maybe even interesting characters but then turn in some weak story that goes nowhere and becomes bogged down with tedious details what 's that what am i supposed to find funny ?
there are however cut outs for your camera speaker mic power button speakers etc in the front so that 's definitely nice
i had high hopes for this book
there is nothing wrong with my stove
i 'm not sure why it 's partly because all those ear bud components actually touch your ears just with less pressure but they still felt like i was being electrocuted
a quick and easy read
this author needs to take time away from writing because there are other publications that actually teach how to get someone excited about their puppy ; but more importantly really do something practical with it
it was n't very impressive for me at all
maybe it 's all about me
if you 're looking to read about this group of characters do yourself as favor and leave it at ' the devil do n't lie '
the story was n't really great and the author did a terrible job with description or making any characters seem real / true to their descriptions
would get a little long winded at times but for every one it starts off real good
do n't bother wasting your money on this product you will just have to try again so do n't waste yours
it came in on time and is holding up well
the characters were one dimensional with little depth the dialogue often wooden for lack of better words and i found it hard even trying to like any character
the price of this printer is very low
this newer one is much smaller and does n't fit
after the first year the pump failed and had to purchase another one after a year
however the replacement unit suffers from two more bad pixels
this thing fell apart in less than a week
i realize it was written over twenty years ago but even when dealing with something as simple and straightforward as the saturn vlaunched second stage engines one ca n't help wondering what else there might really be
the pictures are very small and hard for older eyes or impaired vision people like me
there must be another book coming so there should be i 'd like to see what happens next
broke my screen while installing this with a video game and i 'm not even sure it was the product that 's causing it
this has been a big disappointment
to make matters worse they charged me a hefty return shipping charge as well for defective merchandise
i saw a news story in the paper about this product and it said that everyone thought this was better than water
in my search for a safe '' book i read this one and came across at least seven books maybe more
too many metaphors for me
good quality however the elastic is too tight in a few places leading to discomfort
they were pretty good for the price i paid but did n't like they way how them are made
will see if this works
there is nothing left on the bottom
the case fit perfectly but the plastic on it was very poorly made
99 you 'd be better off skipping this one
however she had issues with her mother and many other people in her family as well as herself that did n't help make me want my own personal reading time while on vacation
this is the worst product
she loves them just not this particular design
even after following all of the directions for setting up my camera in case a stray leaf caught on fire or it happened to be raining it does not stay put at allit never did settle down
wish they would have checked or replaced sooner do n't do it
my 2 chihuahua 's would n't touch these treats
while we have replaced most the door locks one had remained locked into place from before i bought it and could not be opened
i must say that for me the most disappointing parts of this book were the short biographies about each song
i've had no problems with this item
i have read three books in this series and they are all so slow going
i 'm not sure how anybody can rate this cd with 4 stars
this was my book club 's choice for the spring 2012
the pens seemed about average when new but quickly deteriorated
nothing bad happens for some time while it 's taking effect
if it had been 2 inches bigger then that would be perfect
in contrast to other reviews when we purchased the table at pottery barn they installed it and were very good about it
it is n't that simple however
do n't waste your money like mine did
this product is an excellent solution to my coffee addiction
they used too many instruments and not enough voice
i purchased this as a gift for my wife and son in law
so now we have some good stainless steel knives that are still going strong but that 's the problem they 're too short so when you 're cutting something with them you must be very precise or it tends to slide away
this book starts out great with a really good story
there is distortion even on normal volume
i have worn them on 4 different type of terrain with very little walking and it has proven difficult getting my lower leg out of them
while this mouse has decent battery life and is comfortable in hand for all day use it also looses its connection to my laptop frequently
i 'm in total surprise with this book the book is a short read and at just over 100 pages i thought it would take less than 30 min reading for me to finish
it seems like every few weeks she gets a new book so she 's getting way too many duplicates
my advice would be to look at what other customers are saying about products before buying
the cord is extremely short making it impossible to sit on my couch
i bought a new unit from costco today because the last one got to hot on my counter and then it died
even though they have holes in them it is still tricky cleaning them out since there is n't much of an opening
my fault for leaving the charger plugged up all this time but now my laptop can run longer without being plugged in
it did whiten my teeth
i got about 25 pages into the secret life of little bear when i became totally bored with trying to get through it
this is not worth returning as a few bucks but just glad that two work otherwise i 'd be completely unhappy
coffee brand and decided it was time for an upgrade
it will just die soon
the print is light and not a lot you can do to fix this
it held my attention and left me anxious to read the next installment hoping that there would be more of what i enjoyed about the shin
do n't buy it you will be disappointed
threw the thing in the trashand i will be better off buying a good brand name mp3 player
it would totally better if they just did music from star wars
i bought my first one over a year ago and did n't try it out for awhile the price was so good that if it worked i 'd probably buy another one
but not worth spending hours watching i 've probably missed something
it really has nothing in common with pilgrim 's progress which this author also recommends
this is my second pair of these shoes the first had lasted for several yrs
for $ 45 they should totally work
maybe because the lead characters were so cold towards each other
they are really nice but it seems like the color fades after he puts them in a drawer for weeks
but then said if our router is no longer functioning we must return to amazon or netgear
they are just wannabees
i 'm not sure why but they just do n't agree with my body so no matter what pill i take in the future i will try another
a lot of great actors who do n't make it seem like they are acting in complete garbage
but as other reviews point after several years they leak very badly
i bought this to replace an esky camera that had been dropped on my tile floor and stopped working
on the outside this show seemed like it was going to get better with each episode based on reviews i read
hers was from macy 's
this was purchased on 12/26/12 but received about 6 weeks later
well first off the case itself came on time very fast nice packaging
i wish it was taller but i found that out with the other brands of products as well when they are wider
do n't get into the lifestyle of a celebrity and do n't act like your suppose to
but not disappointed in them because at this price
also i 'm not crazy about how low it sets because it does roll around on our flooring
still since most people use these attachments often that 's a small compromise
it looks cool but a little bit flimsy so i really ca n't use it when i 'm doing other things like working out or jogging
i guess that 's what it says for tactical watch its meant for dark environments so maybe we all should just get used to it
when they got this one it was an early publication and there were only two reviews
although i understand some people enjoy it i 'm not a fan
it simply does not have many choices
it seems like you would do better by going and reading all the info yourself
the book is a sad excuse of an attempt by amazon to make money off authors and their works
it 's not terrible and i kept pushing myself through it just because i wanted to see what happens
for example i really wanted a longer zoom 5485
but even with all these caveats sometimes low power works or at least that 's what i 've had happen with these
it 's only good for showing off do n't risk your ipad being dropped onto hard surfaces because you 'd have to replace or repair the case
i 've bought several of these over time so maybe they 're all like this and others are just fine although mine have had more issues than any other similar device
so disappointed in the product
purchased them for riding my motorcycle so wanted headphones that would not pop out of a ear
there have been countless occasions when i 'd go outside and find my garmin laying out on the ground with it 's screen unresponsive
however if my car gets really dark at night which mine does in the winter months even with just one of these lights the difference between this light and other lights that i own are very clear
these are not rechargeable batteries
this product does not work
the screw top part is all there is holding an internal plastic piece
the picture quality is poor and the sound does not pick up his voice
they do n't last even 7 hours
i have a very small bathroom
will be returning it shortly
do you need them or just the product ? they are too cheap to send one
as for comfort do n't expect them
i liked some parts which was n't possible with amazon 's free books
i agree with all the negative comments about this product from those who own a nikon slr
there really was n't any story except for his own attempt to save the world again
if you have already spent countless hours figuring this player out read on
here are just seven things i wanted or expected from it 1
after purchasing this item one pack arrived broken
this one started off with an interesting concept and i thought in the beginning maybe there was a little bit more story to it than some had written but about halfway through all that seemed like the author wanted was for us to guess what the mystery was
i was not able to return it because of being past the 30 day period for exchange
also some of the suggestions seem questionable to me
i only have this camera a week and used it maybe 15 times
it 's due to disney 's desire to try and create another series to compete with its successful pirates of the caribbean
if you are a serious cook who likes her meals to be on the greasy side this book is not for you
not going for anything that can get wet
but disc two is a different story where not only does it sound absolutely hideous as anything but trash we have one single reason for buying this disc
secondly it looks nothing like the photo
the lid closes very tightly no complaints there just annoying
the game just was n't that great
the only good thing about this book was that i bought used
by chance i did notice that these can be installed with just 2 strips in each orientation
i plugged it into my phone for an hour as instructed by another reviewer before using but nothing
of shampoo but rather 24
he uses egypt as if he did extensive research on any topic and would have known much more than a cursory search online by checking out wikipedia or other internet sources
it doesnt attach to anything you have to put it where its needed so the cable can reach
not what it says you get the picture shows 3 pieces
my husband and i purchased them in the fall of last year to replace our old earbuds
for free its ok if your looking to spend money on it look else where but all in all nothing new here
this book was not the best thing i 've ever read which is a shame because it held so many good reviews
for a beginning or intermediate programmer the book may be adequate but if you 're new to any of these topics you could get by just using google and youtube there 's nothing in here that is n't included online ; only things mentioned briefly in passing
she thought life through very different eyes than we have today
these are n't nearly as strong or as well made either
too much repetition in other parts
if it was free ok
the second time was n't as exciting but it was still wonderful
i could n't have been more wrong it did n't fit at all way too tight
this is a very short book
however the other reviewers who gave this item 5 stars must be shills
so i really dont think it would make good cheesecake either
if you need any clarification feel free to send me an email
this was not an accurate copy at all first instead of being 12 volumes each volume only contained 12 stories
the characters were not very well developed
i got this as a gift for my wife
you can read it at your leisure
a bit slow and boring
but not large enough for my foot or ankle after having tried numerous boots
the only reason i give it a single star is because im unable to enter 0 stars
most notably he keeps telling the story from their point of view with no dialogue or dialogue 's response for most pages
unfortunately like any other electronic device sometimes you get defective products that are not handled correctly
they responded well to the buzzer and they loved getting in their daily treats then i set them off when the buzzer sounded
in it he talks about how we all have 5 senses but does n't specify which is which so you can use those for your own benefit
i thought this would be a good coffee maker for the price
laxative ? it 's really a waste of money
this seems a little flimsy but will do if nothing else is available
let 's see how she writes today in 2000
while i thought the storyline line with the girl next door was interesting and could have been made entertaining in some way there were too many problems running together to create an enjoyable or even halfway enjoyable movie
sadly the game 's single player mode is a mixed bag
most if not all other self help books tell you find your passion do it
it comes from china
we would not recommend this product at all
they are n't awful but would n't reccomend
there 's very little meat
i thought this book was the best romance to read of late until i met her second book
when i took off the pizzas there was n't really anything left but that did n't surprise me because you have to be careful with hot pans
this is a very pretty little lamp
this dvd does not have a complete picture for several songs
my husband was pleased when he installed them as they do catch water that goes down from outside
provides great protection against damage from falls but when i wanted to adjust it the plastic snapped
there are n't as many colors shown in pic of product
also it 's tough getting in between all those buttons on your hand after you vaccuum
the dialogue just does n't have that same freshness
but this was written when we did know most details like you ca n't believe how many presidents are involved with affairs at one time
but why they could n't have just included a charger with all these products to be able to charge or sync your devices because i really ca n't see spending $ 30 for a data cable when you can get this that does what its supposed to
it took my husband over 2 hours with a lot of frustration getting everything assembled
they need to try harder at making them more durable
you have to go buy one separately useless
other then that there great
i expected at least 12 14 recipes
a good idea is just that
why do sellers continue selling them
to quote the authors themselves
if i had read the reviews on this before i 'd not have purchased it
a total rip off and waste of time
as long as you do n't expect to get quality tools go for it
unfortunately however there are numerous glaring errors in word usage which cause me considerable difficulty to read
i like these kinds of short stories so i will give the author a second try
on occassion it would still be able plug my laptop into a power strip and charge it but
also while using it part of the case started chipping off
but even if it 's worth less than that so what ? if they use wood for it you ca n't put aluminum on top to protect from uv rays or carbon steel on top
5 hdd which worked flawlessly
would love my money but not at all happy with receiving what appears to be something else entirely
the second one lasted only a month before it stopped working
your readers are being tricked
the radio worked for about 20 hours before the right ear cup quit working
this book was a waste of time because the author does not keep up with current day politics
i am new to the food mill world
there does exist much more useful information available
the first day i used it we walked around our neighborhood and while taking a picture everything was fine for about 10 minutes
this will never ever help anyone
not sure how she managed to cram in so much about her marriage within those 180 pages
live & learn right ?
when we purchased this my son wanted another pirates video made by disney
you wo n't get better from him
it actually feels kind of good about giving money directly to the people who are perpetrating these kinds of scams when watching it
this is smaller than we thought did n't think about measurements so now it 's on our deck
but at least the case has the same problem as other people mentioned which is once you put it on there 's a hard rubber gasket that protects every aspect from dust and water
neither port would plug into the wall or computer
i was totally disappointed with this one
i was looking for an inexpensive nomuss and probably somewhat effective alternative to a lot of the really expensive preamps that are sold in audio gear shops
this does n't necessarily mean it 's a bad thing it just makes me wonder about the author 's personal taste at certain points
i 'm glad amazon had them in stock but next time i will go to a local dealer or at most walmart where there will probably be other choices
would have been a great idea if they just worked
i did get interested in what happened to mary ann 's son after he left college which made me keep reading when suddenly there was no more discussion of these issues not even with regard to his mother
you would be better off with the keurig system
if you 're going listen to the lies you will feel like your head has been punched in by one of those overweight stupid punks wearing the white shirt with his pants down
no other damage that would have gone undetected
if this had been book 2 i would have felt let down
this season is even poorer than the first in a lot of regards
the case is well built
she seems almost bored with trying to figure something out
look for something else
there are some good points of this book that i will definitely consider doing for my kids but the rest of it is so ridiculously oversimplified and silly on a number of occasions when explaining scientific principles to children
we were doing a fix because every time we stopped feeding a certain food he had problems again with vomitting
the story is a standard vampire story
if your new start in emergency care or first time with ems this may be useful
also sometimes her investigations go no where
if you have any real interest in this subject which i do read the authors other works they are very good
they work fine but they are not what is pictured they have white labels in the center
we have been looking into getting rid of cable and tv in her house since she has started to get diabetes so i thought it would be fun or something different if we bought her some kind of entertainment center
i cannot stand it
but the seller was fast in shipping the product so its good
the light is too bright for him right now but he loves it the battery in mine started losing its charge really fast
problem being it 's simply not interesting
not expensive at all
this was less money than what one would pay at walmart so if you want something that will work ok until it fails after 1 year and you 're willing to put up with poor performance it 's worth it
just wo n't happen again
but if you 're looking for a phone case you will do fine
my best recommendation for you is try another product
please make sure you get what you ordered because they changed everything up but still sent the same book
i wrote to them about it numerous times in a few weeks
i really enjoyed the first book in this series
it was easy to connect via bluetooth however after using it for a week on my laptop that is hooked up to my hdtv all you got were static lines absolutely worthless the sound quality was n't too bad and when plugged in directly into tv no issues at all
i 've been a fan of linda lael miller 's books and was disappointed with it
the rest of the book reads like a sales pitch / infomercial for their books
do not waste 2 hours renting this watch paint dry save some money instead as thats about what it 's worth
but over time however the battery would not hold a charge
perfect size at lunch boxes
also in several spots the book says things that are n't true such as the description of how to eat a raw chicken
do n't buy from them
no problem just took out two screws in back top of unit no connectors opened up case thank you amazon customer service then popped in batteries from old remote reattached little hole where battery connector was and voila the remote worked fine
this book to sell something is a poorly conceived treatise by stephen king
i am going to pass the test with flying colors
i tried to use this for my i pad 3 with the speck cover
even if you get them right away they will charge for shipping and not pay for return shipping just cancel it
the author of this book had the audacity to refer himself as a christian
do n't waste your money if trying this product
i guess maybe it 's ok if you watched it but not good enough or well done to watch more than once
this is our second unit and we will never buy another one from amazon
if i knew for sure there would n't be problems i 'd recommend buying something else
i will no longer buy a digital copy
it made no sense whatsoever so much time spent setting up details for people but not going anywhere
theresa after having read reviews for the penguin version and found it more interesting given all of its historical information
in his book americans for democracy professor michael lind calls attention to various phenomena that indicate increasing economic inequality
this was clearly someone with whom life had been difficult and people liked her maybe because they felt sorry for her
now even before they get here we have 3 sets broken down
it does n't work what a piece of garbage i 've been meaning to contact amazon for warranty service as it 's only 2 months old
okay for general purpose work but a little weak on precision work
the screen goes blank and none of us can get to it
it 's actually not even good as toilet paper
i will use my two that are n't working
seemed like it was written to meet some deadline
the color is what we needed & they were much cheaper compared to other sites
a poorly constructed plastic bucket
he has his own place about 7 hours away but wanted something better than those junk thermometers included with portable air conditioners
however as another review pointed out this book is absolutely not grounded on theology
the next chapter takes them up more into the online world where you can buy products and services online
the only reason i purchased this camera was due to its size
the title of my first ride implies that it will be an adventurelike story but it 's mostly a long rambling account about how he got his first motorcycle
it may be fine for other purposes but when you are going to carry around a bunch of stuff on it do n't cheap out and buy this
the quality of the puzzle wasn¡t great either
my husband was raised as one too we were both given books on sunday morning by our parents my parents being christians but most importantly my father even attended church with their friends occasionally
after two weeks of using every night battery only lasted 3 days it suddenly stopped working even though it 's still on a brand new battery
children should be encouraged as they grow toward greater achievements
this guy would scare me if they were still alive today
however for someone like myself who has a lot of experience doing small projects around my house some help would be nice
it 's probably too late now though
what can i say
i will be looking for another case
i bought this at the beginning of october and by mid december it broke for no apparent reason
bought as a christmas gift for my 6 yr old
although the first two reviews by a
i felt this was more of the authors personal rambling
a waste but lesson learned
really ???? in my opinion not one thing about this story made sense
they should put better tape on packaging i ca n't believe anyone did n't notice that since it 's stuck into the paper
i 've called the company twice the second time i was put in touch with an indian who promised something would be done
it was an inferior product
its worth reading about why richard ii was wrong than see it
my advice ? do n't bother
you can get just as much information by going to project runway 's official website
the second layer is n't as easy to do right but if you 've got lots you will end up doing that when using it
i guess you get what you pay for right ? the price for these used books is pretty low so it can be forgiven
this one is slightly lower when looking through it but do n't get your hopes too high
save your money and get something else
not very happy with this one
i cannot get any action on it
now we will have another cd waiting when my son grows up
for those wishing to purchase an inexpensive stereo system which includes speakers the pyle pfa21003 8 channel digital stereo receiver and dvd player should work fine
it 's a good thing they were cheap
it does n't say anything new and it really does not seem at all wellresearched
we recently purchased the oreck xl platinum and loved it before using the vacuum
so back to amazon for a replacement
what more could you want ? nice design and very lightweight
i bought this book because as a teacher of literature for children at a university in france i 've run across many stories with similar themes or ideas to the three little pigs
if your interested on how software development can become more user friendly then you will enjoy it
what bothers me is how it is supposed to taste all kinds of nuts in every shake and after 2 days of usage i 'm still hungry
other than that it 's great fun once completed
the texture was too watery for my taste
i returned the first one because of this
what a disappointment this book was n't even well written and should have been listed under cheap book
it was really big on me i loved his jacket but to short and the arms are way big im still a little upset over that but other than that he is a good character in both the game and movie
the book does have a lot of information but the stories do seem rather contrived and it is hard to remember who has said what
she loves to wear it for the first month or so but then will stop wearing it
it only made contact when we moved her hand over them
at times it felt like a chore not a pleasure
i wish i could write a good review but this book is about half the length and probably not worth it
a big problem for me is all these ingredients i do n't have or know where to get them so it looks to be useless to me
the foam that covers all the earpieces is almost gone after only 3 months of use
it was not worth the amount we paid
but it has n't so i 'm trying to get through this
mchugh 's writing and have read all her books except the white house
it needs to be tweaked
my rating would have gotten lower if it was possible but it 's notthe 3 stars is generous
so then what 's going on ? for me maybe there has been too little experience with writing fantasy or any fantasy for that matter
i was expecting a book for the normal user
the design is great though like most velcro bows but its just not quite quality material
the instructions for unpacking are in chinese though obviously translated to english or german
the author does make some good points including the fact that it is far too early to judge whether america has won its war
this book was all over the place on most of it and did not give me any helpful information
it 's a waste of time reading it
it seems as though the author decided how many pages should be in a novel based on where he could fit most pertinent information
there were a lot of scenes that only the director could make into something it was n't
they sent me a cd
why should anyone take me seriously if i do n't subscribe to any religion ? to prove my point i will give you another story illustrating how i think americans regard nonbelievers
the book is not very well written
after reading it my opinion is still pretty negative about this book
plus the pink part is just white with painted on
this unit would have been very helpful had i managed to do more than set all my time on one side of the display in 5 minute increments
have read complaints about touchpads too
i think it 's written for younger children then it was intended by the author
if you 're going through what i went through than just listen to these songs
i have purchased more expensive speakers and they put out better sound than this
there is no smell at all so that alone could have convinced us to keep it but after putting on one sheet of tissue paper it 's not easy this seems more like masking tape on your hands we saw there were many areas where the coloring had smeared about an inch long across both areas
and the fact that all these speakers work on rechargeable batteries makes me mad
the only possible reasons i can think why anyone would buy one of these books are 1 they want a piece or two and / or 2 someone gave them one
the thing would not work at all
i was disappointed because this is my husbands favorite brand but with the expiration date on it
that part seemed rushed leaving you wanting more details
good starting place though
i just cannot read this book it appears that the ebook is only in black and white even though it 's called kindle edition
the latest attempt is getting back on track after updating drivers from hp website
these fit nicely over the ears which was surprising
she was not overly impressed with the book
two major reasons why i 'm giving it one star
however the are not very comfortable
it will no longer work in any settings
like many others i picked this up at my local bookstore and was quite excited about it
nothing about it stood out
you 're better off buying something made by genuine manufacturer for what you 're actually paying for
the box itself is not damaged but for a product like this it needs to be properly closed and / or secured prior to shipping
installed two months later same problem happened within days
the sex scenes were good to but not enough of them
if your account has enough money left then there probably is some value here
i returned this item because it says in the description that it is compatible with windows 7 but upon receiving it there was no box for it
still it does provide good basic information
a good product but still have a little issue finding my kitty
but i would have liked deeper character development
this book went off into different plot lines and really left you confused about who did what etc
this review is actually about the audio cd and not as a response to this review
some other reviewers liked it but not me for me
now im stuck with an unused 8gb that was wasted
it is a good product i like its looks but the product should hold its shape better
my first brush had only recently fallen apart not quite 3 months old
this product did work fine
when using flash it drains very fast
however was disappointed by the first chapter on page 3 when they were all running through the yard to find their home
well turns out you only need 6 pieces
it 's been 2 years since i 've had them
my old pan lasted 20 years
i would say it does its job if used correctly
the movie did n't make any sense at all
they are cute and just the right size but they do not include the screw caps at all
it is a very funny story with lots of action
this book felt like an attempt by a writer using her name for marketing purposes who really does n't know how to write erotic novels
i felt like there were four books in one and then they had to split up so everyone could sell each book individually
the next day all but 2 pieces were gone with no warning and not a single crumb in any of his bowls
this book was an embarrassment
for whatever reason the disc would not work
he 's written some great characters that you care about
i 'm wondering what will happen when washing them
was so excited to get this
you will definitely pay more right ? i recommend buying from some one that has been around awhile and makes good products
other than the initial cost and storage hassle it does provide great quality smoothies
what a dissapointment within days of turning it on every song skips no matter where you hit the fast forward button
you ca n't change songs by moving the finger from next to right ear which is very bothersome
my biggest issue with this book is the lack of historical accuracy
to say that there is no leftover in here would indicate something else was added
my kids did like how they made it look but only had limited fun in using them
it does n't work well for large jobs
most pictures have a blue hue to them
i have had bad luck with these chargers from the start
there is no way this book deserves even one star ; it was actually a waste of time and money
i still plan to buy any other books this author may release
this would be a great product if it were not so difficult to turn off and on
but for 99 cents it 's a good read
this company needs better customer service
i 'm still listening through it but it makes me want to tear out my ears
i do n't usually write negative reviews but in this case it takes more than half of the book for me to actually learn anything about an artist i 'd like to look into further something i can only say is disappointing
buy something from target
we returned at a loss as he took care of it
i would say as good in some aspects if they did n't have that fake sound to them
this book is an okay read
a wonderful cast who are fun to watch
do n't waste your money unless you 're throwing them out after a couple months anyway
so save your money keep shopping there stuff sucks
he describes his mother 's experiences as a young girl being swept off her feet so to speak by two men one of whom was older at least four years both with families
maybe they are best on smaller heads where there might not need to be a lot of power behind them
this is a great idea and as well made the way it was made
when using this product and following the instructions to charge it as per the instructions within 23 weeks my dog 's ears were really itching
the cover was bent so that my daughter had to tape it back up which made her really upset
after reading half way and only keeping it so that i could read reviews on it i 'm very sad that i made such a poor choice
a better player has been put out on the market with equalizers so one can set equalizer levels to match one 's personal preferences
this was somewhat informative however one must be familiar with commercial brand names before venturing into amateur cooking
it is cute but there are better options
two months later i am noticing my daughter has scratched some of her old cds up
as an adult these were still funny at times when i as little kid could relate with these characters and situations which makes me understand why kids loved them
not only that but there were so many characters from book 1
it still has plenty of funny lines but this time around it 's not funny
i can read an entire novel in one day
as someone who enjoys all thrillers i 'm glad fincher got nominated for best director
the album itself is excellent but will be returned
there was nothing wrong with it but not quite up to standards
however the story is unique and intriguing
i bought this set and was really dissapointed
it says on their product that only works for up to 5 days so you have to keep using it every day which defeats the purpose
both flashlights were working fine when they died
although this book started out quite good as far as paranormal romances go once something exciting happens it ends abruptly
and yes i used another power adapter with this so it 's definitely the product
there are fake brands that contain more manmade chemicals
the game was ok for a very long time until it stopped working altogether and i will not give anymore money to this company that i have dealt with in the past
and by loud i mean unbearably loud compared to any other dvd player you 're going to no matter what the price
the box says for windows 98 and the disc that came with it does n't work on any of my operating systems
0 out of 5 stars this is like reading the authors notes
for about five years now i 've bought several dewalt drills including three 18 v versions so far one 12 v and now this
even for only $ 30 dollars it 's probably worth paying someone else $ 50 dollars or so and getting what you need
i can read a book just about anytime and really love them even when they are bad
however being a fan of the fugitive and tv shows about the chase it did not hold my interest as well
price was good as well
the description for this item reads fits all i pads not just i pad 3
i wanted more action fewer descriptions and an overall tighter plot
do n't waste your money this seems like one of those ghost written books with no research and very little editing done
i 've read about three other books by this author before this also horrible and do n't be surprised if she decides never again to write any more books because she 's obviously getting desperate
it seemed like it took forever for them to realize they loved one another maybe even forever ? and why did the author go so overboard trying to show their relationship developing from nothing into something that can last a lifetime complete with every emotion he put in it ? the writing is pretty good as usual if you enjoyed previous books by demille
in our country we are surrounded by many wonderful stories that can be used as part of teaching moral lessons on manners and manners
wrong instead buying the cheaper and better quality treats at walmart they seem to contain fresher ingredients with no fillers or byproducts so your dogs will actually eat them
then another piece of tiny glass came off which did n't affect any light
was not helpful at all
update 1/7/13 a couple of months down the road and it 's already falling apart
there are a variety of smoothie blends and even protein shakes
do we have to take them all off right away the rest of book looks pretty cute
do not buy this record you will regret it
did n't even like reading her how to 's
at first glance it does sound good
it 's not even remotely the same
i ca n't believe there 's no mention of either the cia this is supposed to be a thriller about spies going up against terrorists
it does n't take three hundred pages before edward calls bella her true love
it is really hard to see the screen when outdoors
however this book really left me disappointed
they only sell half sizes no other sizing is available
this worked okay for a few weeks
i will keep you posted
i will give another try but was a waste of my money
the plot was terrible bad characters terrible acting
this book has very simple rules and is fun to read while doing housework
also purchased 2 pairs & one does n't keep them on
this is very attractive and a great idea but it arrived without one of the brackets to attach with screws
the book looks good but there is no way we can put her gift in it
very disappointed too bad b/ c my dog loved it it 's only a matter of days so we are out $ 30
if you like books that have a happy ending then this probably is n't for you
this is a horrible book it may be ok for one chapter but not the final book
i was really disappointed with this book and the story it contained because of all the cliché dialog
i 've been using this since january 2012 if not before and by may 2013 they were already too short for my long hair
after the first day someone took it to best buy because i could not take picture after one day
you are supposed to replace the batteries every month
we started with book two and then added this one since we had become interested in following these characters through their time in jail
the book was a complete waste of time
when i checked amazon 's website page for accessories there were no reviews which told me they where sold out
after about two weeks of constant use one set died then the other three were no longer working
the product is probably ok but this vendor sold me 2 items that were supposed to be identical
would not recommend to anyone with children
this is n't hardcore by any means
however after reading countless reviews from both consumer sites like cse pc world etc
overall we like having it
i guess in many areas some people are like that lol it 's a funny book but if you 're looking for substance about living life just watch tv
this thing looks so flimsy and i really did n't feel all confident putting a camera into it especially one worth more than my camera
i ca n't remember how many times in the last couple years i 've listened to a disc with some of these songs and thought really ? no real new stuff here at all ? i do n't think this is really bad but it 's not quite as good or diverse and less fun than the previous record
i have now had 2 of these in the few weeks that i owned them
this is not an original product
in fact i 've taken off all the pages because it 's going into our charity shop box
my title says it all
the acting is n't too good as is very predictable & really stupid
it will charge to 80 percent but never go into a condition that allow it to run down until the charger said 100 % charged
now another one broke just after its own warranty also in less than 2 weeks
this game is a decent game but i will never ever by another ea game
it was pretty hard watching since we had rented it
i would love to return it for my money back or exchange the correct product
i bought this on the recommendation of cooks illustrated who loves it it seems ok but it wo n't work for me i 'm short and in a kitchen like mine there is n't even enough room to open it
my one complaint would be that sometimes when using this brush hair or other bits get stuck to it
too many words to describe what would have been interesting in the hands of a writer
do not buy this if you do n't know how to use it
they just seem overly imprecise
it fell apart as soon as the first drop of shampoo was put on it
this book does provide some great advice but its the exact same information available in any other training book
tried plugging in a few different usb devices into it and nothing happened
they are very cheap quality as compared with other brands
it might be helpful for someone who needs a pep talk with little substance or if the big picture has been buried under other ideas
i bought the kindle version of this book and it seemed to me that all you can read in a few pages are two words written at the top money or baddies
however if any part breaks there is not much you can do even if it 's fairly minor
meaning the lid could not be locked or any part would come off
i 'm glad it 's over with
the red on yellow design makes them very easily recognized
i got this to replace a 10 year old black and decker cordless drill
we do n't recommend this product
this book covers the information needed for a basic introduction
they can both fit on this with room left over
i have been trying to get my hands on some of the older books by this author and was excited when i found one for $ 0
i 've done everything to clean them out vinegar alcohol etc
i have had a couple of other canon printers
i 'm trying for my second one this season
her earlier ones were usually better
i 've ordered cases from amazon before and while they do take awhile for them too fall apart it 's still better than one i 'd been using up until now
also though written by a christian there were several references that did n't quite agree with my beliefs
i use mine for showersnot good if you want to enjoy your music
i was so disappointed to discover that my old dvd was n't the original and did not include english subtitles despite what it said on product page
what was great on their first cd and what will hopefully bring them some recognition now has become quite boring but at least something catchy
this was probably an excellent book when it is written but it 's hard for me as the reader to make sense of
ca n't open and close
the first 3 chapters basically describe them
i would not recommend to others
they were also fairly easy to install
if you 're new to jane austen and would like a general overview of her you might find this easy enough but if you 've already read any amount of her fiction you will have no idea at all about what she thought of each other outside their professional relationships
the top was sewn oddly
also gets very hot
i have read several of these self help or selfhelp books and this is the first one i 've ever felt needed another edit
if you could condense this into several hundred pages then the story would be better at least for me
the second one lasted 2 weeks then the same problem
we did n't even read much more than 3 stories before we started skipping through everything
for example if you 're an experienced bartender there 's stuff on how much different pumps are things about lighting techniques for drinks etc
because it is n't going to work
the first book is very well written and so much fun
this was a dissapointing read as the cover and blurbs led readers to expect something that could rival a discovery of witches & other paranormal literature
i've heard about this film getting a cult status
the storyline is predictable and there are too many pages wasted on repetitive information such as the descriptions surrounding how people moved or their names
however once i tried putting it together was unable to
not sure if i missed something in the instructions
we then proceeded to assemble it
in addition the controls need work and it 's a really tight game almost impossible to shoot at any target since you always have your gun aimed straight at you
so take my advice as what you will be getting do n't waste your time on it
for example there are some great tips on how to create a real life action plan but not nearly enough ideas for actually having an exercise day or if in fact you do workout from your journal
if you 're looking at these just do it
it was not what i expected
we will probably pass on this purchase in future since it 's too unreliable to risk buying another one we may just go back to buying them locally
i had to cut a part off of it so that it would fit
my son really likes cars and we purchased him this one for christmas
maybe for someone in search of real techniques would it prove useful
the writing style of this author is so horrible that i can barely finish
i am returning mine
although the characters were not bad just nothing new happened for me
and what bothers me even more is that there were no other reviews of this product prior to purchase that 's a big problem if things like this happen on amazon
what kind of service is this ? i just wanted to read my book please tell how long you expected the book to take ? or when they expect them back
i can say that this is a good screen protector at least if you 're very careful
you could almost call them ' alternate endings ' ; it 's hard to get into one without feeling cheated at missing out on the full impact
in my opinion it is poorly packaged for shipping
it 's not as easy or simple as the title makes it sound
the author came up with one of the worst scenarios ever
one of the worst movies ever i would not recommend it to anyone even with robert duvall in it
just not durable enough
the product is good for the price
would not recommend it at all
5 mm to miniplug audio jack
i have used this book for years and absolutely love it even though the content is outdated
i 'm not quite sure how to express my utter frustration with this movie
unfortunately when he recounts his experiences stateside specifically how to pick up chicks i find what he 's writing about pretty boring
the knob broke off while screwing into it
just do a search and choose download if they are available
i have received my order in good condition new
perhaps i 'm missing something perhaps he 's talking about something other than the main event
and that really stinks
maybe some people will enjoy it
it 's a pity because this genre of romance is usually pretty good but if you really do n't care about these things it 's not totally terrible
i bought this for my daughter last year and it is now broken at the bottom after 6 months
the first battery worked like magic for several months but did gradually not charge properly
nothing in here that is not already common practice to begin your online dating or work out on your own
it shows the true story of how the british army dealt with germany during wwi
it 's one thing to have a poor quality product but even if it were made well it 'd still take up space in your kitchen cabinets
i think it was worth the price for a used one
but it 's got problems for me at least
i will be sending it back today
save your money you are better off with old vhs
i've had similar problems with both of our lexmarks
they must have had an accident on their assembly line
go with another brand if you 're going a little higher class so they can at least protect themselves a little
they need to remove about half the coconut or replace some other flavoring
that knocked all the protective screen off
the first time we thought one of our tapes had bad sound
you would be better off with something from skull candy or sennheiser
i should also add that i 'm female so do n't even get me started
i 'm on my 3rd bottle
not worth buying it
and the one with the little piece fell out
but they need to get some better musicians
nothing exciting happens they have sex buy groceries go out and do stuff
i ca n't think of anything specific to do about that
the unit is as advertised
there needed to have been a better plot and there was the potential for it but this is my second attempt at getting through it
and if you 're going for looks go another way
at first it was ok though but then after two weeks of constantly removing it i 've had an opportunity to take everything off again trying to wear it
the thing that makes it usable is the retractable cord
the reviews were good on amazon so maybe i will get better editing in future as opposed to reading an error riddled mess out of my kindle
the plot was rather confusing and hard to follow which is a problem the writer had maybe it would have gotten simpler if he tried more books
to say this guy has a lot of success in business isan understatement ; he certainly owns every successful businessever
no new informaiton here
however when connected to my camera there was no longer a one inch length cord included the one i got from amazon was just over 6 inches
after several pages it became more than that and had to put it aside
when the product was working maybe 6 months it would give me one or more blue lights when plugged in
if you do n't need something super sturdy it will do the job but that 's about it
really ? if you 're going to go for an indie author try one who at least knows english grammar
i like the idea of this item but when it arrived and put a new battery inside to test it only 5 light up not as advertised
as a college grad myself and former member of the army i appreciate all that this guy went through but he 's still just selling people how the world used to be
its ok didnt stick well to my ipad screen but not sure if its just me
when i first saw him with my little one on tv i just had to have the series as we would watch it together
my poor baby actually got sick from it in shock after having chewed that horrible taste into his mouth
if your looking for a good quality portable speaker i would not buy it
even some other products line up with most standard standards but none have been as bad on delivery
if something goes wrong during normal use then things could happen e
you really just end up guessing which hole will be right
the only thing this book is good for is getting it off the shelves
its certainly different from anything else out there
what good is that ? not really useful
the author is an excellent writer but i hate books too short especially those of her type
you should know it 's not very good
she writes sentences that look at sentence fragments but which actually show how much she was writing out in order to fill up the pages
if you are looking to buy it then go ahead and try it
i was expecting a step by step guide on how to create detailed maps but what you are given in the first chapter covers all the information so if that would be useful for someone who wants just straight out map making it 's missing here
it arrived well before christmas which was great because it would have been my son 's big present for the entire year
if you have ever experienced any of the benefits i described and in general enjoy a good romance novels chances are you will like this one as well
i 'm definitely returning mine
she 's only 9 months old and loves anything with hair
i 'm glad that other people have had better luck with this battery as it is a replacement for my dell laptop
dont waste your time as me buy something else
as far as i know there is no other explanation for this author 's lack of skill and talent
when you order this item it sounds just like new but in fact when you have an estimated shipping date of 58 business days it actually takes over 30 days
changed cables multiple times everything came back on
it may be the only one of its kind and it certainly has some merits
in addition some of the tapes were distorted and out of sync
i bought this phone as a replacement for my old uniden cordless digital answering system that finally died after many years of use
it does not say in decription that is a fake screen protector
the reason i gave it one star is they do n't make the product that was advertised on tv
the picture will come out dark and washed out
they come way down my lower leg i 'm 5 ' 7
kids think its the greatest game they do n't really want anything challenging so they tend to give things easy scores but at least on occasion their cards come out
i was so excited to learn that a new album by the great david sylvian aka steve hillage would be released last year
my book club chose this title for its historical aspects based on our research of and reading about the french revolution
i 've always bought the oem version from amazon when these cartridges started to run low they only last about two weeks with my printer and i tried several of these
i learned a few things about dragons
the manufacturer claims compatibility to win 7 and 8 however they are wrong although i ca n't imagine any of them will work
we bought these for our outdoor picnic table
i realize its title promises to be innovative but that hardly translates into innovative content
even though there were no other items left out since we ate so much meat that same day that 's still unacceptable performance by what is supposed to be top quality food
it only lasted 7 days before it broke
my son opened it for christmas and the metal broke off inside his foot
i will probably try another from this author since it is difficult to find a good vampire series in fantasy but the execution of that story left something lacking
he does really like it
horrible for outside with flash & night shots
after installing it we found that the channel had no reception at all
the description states that the illustrations are cute but there is allot of repetition in the book
this is an amazing product and makes life so convenient the only problem with mine is that i 've had to send two of them back already due to malfunctioning but amazon replaced both units immediately update it just died again
this is a very cheap and poorly made product it does not work at all
i'd like another review when he actually gets it
if you take something and want your life to change then that 's ok
do n't expect good photos on this thing
this is a great game for the whole family we love to play it together and everyone can win
the cost is 3 x more expensive than what we paid for it but it works better right out of the box
the product looks great the sound is nice but it keeps cutting in and out for no reason what so ever
you have to unplug everything from the computer which is inconvenient but just as usable
all my friends and family seem impressed with this product
it 's not it 's a real stinker
the author really needs to look into writing some good literature instead of this tripe
however when unpacking it we noticed a piece of metal on top was bent not only could you see the bend but obviously does effect function
jesus comes for us
the product is fine unfortunately it was opened and the batteries were dead when i got home to install them into my remote as soon as i put battery in it it would not work then after resetting multiple times and trying again for another few days now its no longer working never ever will use this seller from amazon again
stick with orange pecan it 's actually good
patterson would do this with his readers and in our children 's book collection
i was looking forward to a more in depth study of the life and / or teaching and influence of francis schaeffer but instead found mr
never worked do n't waste your money
this is an absolute waste of money
it 's better than nothing
the book was a christmas present for someone else
mine did not taste sour on opening and my son can eat them so maybe mine has an expired date
they should n't be allowed to sell it
the other books in this series are much better
however about half a year after owning it the fabric underneath started separating from the case
very hard in today 's busy world
however when we got it the package said made for i phone 5s
it was supposed to stream from the internet so we would n't have an additional cable line running through our home
this was my first negative review ever written
the layout of stories are confusing too much information about one event would make it harder to know where the story actually takes place each country seems divided into two regions a second major country then two others
it simply does n't work
i have to admit when it works it 's great
this is the first time i have left a poor review on amazon because i 'm so mad about this product that i needed to let others know
i ordered this a month ago and was disappointed by the low quality of the product
i bought this phone for my father who has macular degeneration and is in a nursing home
i 'm no professional recording engineer but come on i would have done better putting this together myself in my garage using some cheap stereo mixer
now i have to go out again tomorrow for ink and pay shipping both ways
one thing that 's nice to have it it 's easy cleaning ; just remove the suction cup with some warm water then wipe down
the print was not clear
i got this phone to replace a panasonickxtg4030 that had finally lost its power and static
i had never heard of these guys ; all the other songs are great
will not be buying another book from this author
we did n't do the simple setup and the wireless function could not be established over 2 days of attempted setup
this will be one of those items that gets tossed aside after trying to use it and then used with very little success in subsequent setups
where is it ? i 've been charged like $ 26
the writing is very good
my son will be extremely disappointed we are returning it
if i 'd known i 'd still be reading this stuff after getting through chapter 6 i would n't bother
and that 's before you can even start trying treats in it
i tried charging it powering it on multiple times etc
i 'm glad she was able to put it all together at the end but for those wanting more background her father died shortly thereafter
i would just suggest the author edit this before publishing
however all of these were fairly new books and i 've found them more helpful
yoder & robert r
for some reason after reading another book by an author whom takes more time it 's nice since he tells you
this seems kind of pointless
amazon needs a better solution for customers
tried it on the two different vehicles i tried it on and still no luck
i will be sitting down on the couch and suddenly it 's connected
i did it last night
i just wanted something different
it broke as i opened it
this printer was a gift to my son about 3 months ago
i think if someone took grammar & sentence structure 101 or even basic writing class they could more easily write this book
i felt like i did n't learn much by reading this book
this is a movie that is made for the fans and not for those who prefer to sit back in their seats with popcorn and have something entertaining and mindless on hand just to pass some time
it seems that my dog just is n't that interested in this bone
i wont get another one from you
i was looking forward to reading this book but found it too dark and violent for my taste
all this product does is create a fog and makes the screen look more dull than before
will not buy anything with his name or likeness that has been made
i bought this thinking the design is cute but when it arrived i realized that it really is n't
the first one i received worked great
after two listens through in a row i 'm not bothering to listen again
but how much fun does this book have ? it 's actually not fun
this is okay at best
the quality of the product was great
love stories are my favorite so it was nice seeing both points of view
even with adjustments on the back you can hardly hear a thing
the elastic bands are so tight that if the earpiece itself is not positioned perfectly against your ear or any other ear cartilage at all pulling them far enough down they will stay put
first time viewer here i did not think much else might be great but after sitting in bed for 3 days nothing happened other than being boring
i purchased this camera with high expectations because of the very good reviews and it had no reviews
i will buy some more if someone in china brings them over here or sends me
to make up for it half way thru each episode most conversations are cut short after so many years and we ca n't even hear how the actors talk
no big deal though because as long as she has n't touched anything it 's cool
did not meet my expectations
this book is a collection of several articles by various authors about the different strategies employed throughout history from using religion to propaganda as tactics in politics
maybe if this had been part 2 or even better still part 3 then i 'd have enjoyed them more
very disappointed very weak story line and the characters did not grab me
the fork was fine but both forks have since broken
this is not an apple product
most of the text was a summary list of vocabulary words and a very shallow explanation
i wo n't take away from what she went through though
these are just a few authors whose books i 've enjoyed by far more
this seems simple enough that it should n't be hard but once they get into running and try to finish then they realize there 's so much mental energy you could spend reading something like this
my 9 year old likes it but i 've never heard a kid say the things that are said in it
do n't buy it
will see how long its gonna last
this is my first time purchasing and using a blender
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it looked like such a great concept
when my husband used it he was wearing one of his workout clothes as soon as you put the collar on it it gets tangled or caught in everything
so why do we spend money buying their books ? at least write out 10 pages and call it an outline if you really want a story
it fits around me but because of the material i 'm guessing that would leave some bulges on my waist
i will be returning this one
we needed some extra microphones in our office especially when we have multiple users there at once
this is a cheap knockoff
if you want something cute or practical to throw a little treat in go with doggie paws
the story is really cute too also for those reviews about how much more fun it 's when you sing them songs with all different words than they normally hear on t
there is too much potential for a good series here
i would never recommend this product you get what you pay for and that was cheap very disappointed what good are things if you cant use them
first off it 's not compatible with a mac computer
we were unable to use it ; we sent pictures via email to amazon along with our complaint
save yourself some money buy something else i 'm surprised that razer can allow these products out under their name
it seemed cheap to me
all in all it was an ok product especially at that price
i expected less action in all three movies and got more
if you 're expecting it to vacuum you 'd be disappointed even with brand new batteries
but without any kind of signal loss or connection problems getting signals through seemed almost impossible
for someone who 's only had one adventure already this is a lot of money
please fix this problem for people who bought this
as other reviewers have said it 's nothing new just regurgitated information that we 've all read
the resolution is so poor that you can barely read anything on the screen and what it does display looks pretty awful
a waste of time shipping it back for refund
i did n't really find much interesting or useful in it
its as if your trying to get over 700 pages
well i 'm not one bit surprised though by now i 've got all of it
for instance in one section she tells us i know all about your problems i suffered from them too and so can you
made it difficult to close due to how the bottom of thedefective and material in the front did not match up
hope mine was an exception
these glasses are okay and do seem to help with puffiness
the sound is horrible no matter how much you try to get it adjusted
after all it 's a real i pad and even includes a keyboard dock
spend 10 extra and get a real bulb
the lyrics are bland at best and have zero dept
it is not like new as described
do n't waste your money on this
i love all three other bunn home coffeemakers
and if it matters at all when you 're reading reviews read them
as a professional photographer with years on the field i can tell you that this book is n't about anything
the seller however made things better by responding very quickly
my tv accepts all other resolutions ie 1080 and 480 p
so when my tv began to act up again just a few minutes after plugging back into power i figured i 'd go dvd instead of bluray
i 've ordered many products from amazon over the years and this may be my least favorite
just something others should be aware of when considering purchase
i was so excited then immediately put it down
looking forward too reading all these books
the thing that upsets me even more is that it does n't fit
when we moved into our new house in 2013 or so they were having major problems with it
this story could have been told in half the pages
it arrived and it 's too long on her but she does n't mind
not as good as at all as we had hoped for & will return if possible as this company has sold bad merchandise
it was poorly researched and written
but i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie worse than this
there 's another book available as well titled the art of craft making crafts
we wanted to replace an aged coffee maker and obviously we have a krups brand of brewer and needed kcups
we did not receive that one either it had been broken when received
when playing games with friends their voices sounded distorted at higher volumes
for example why did n't she call at his house again to see what is going on between them and how they are getting on ? or when will he come home ? those were important questions
if you want cheap cases these are good for that but do n't expect them to last long
after two months they burn out again
and so this book which cost me over $ 200 at my local bookstore was what we decided would be most appropriate
these folks ca n't write
you can make better ones yourself in less time anyway
not worth spending $ 28 on this
the ingredients on the box are fine according to my dog
and not only that but he tells you which stories will be your own in 3 pages
the authors should either be ashamed or have their professional credentials revoked
0 i tried one right away when they came but could n't bear to risk it
i have tried to install it on three different machines and they all have some sort of driver problem
they need constant adjustment as they fall out of my ear all the time
but if you looking into buy it go ahead and try it
there are also some weird concepts that make absolutely no sense when trying them out including making fun for your child after you 've completed his test
there were huge lines in every image that had no resolution
as long they are doing it in an interesting enough way
pros this is a lot bigger and has more space than my original the locking feature for pouring without making a mess something that happened with all my originals in about a year does n't seem to be broken yet
it is a beautiful piece of work and i will order more for my family members
will just use my old ones now
i used it and didnt do much
they arrived very quickly and although everything fit together just fine there were multiple broken pieces
the writing style is choppy with little flow in story or character development
i like her writing style some of the scenes were cute even though it started out to be a sweet romance story there ended up being too much graphic sex
both spend most of their time making assumptions instead of talking out problems
i 'm returning it do not buy
i bought this book for my son who is in kindergarten at school
this shoes were super cute
not really sure what happened with mine but i 'm disappointed with it
i bought this book thinking it would give me a lot of insight about how the body works how to deal with stress etc but the basic stuff that 's in here is common sense
she is a great writer who writes books using different characters in each one you know what they do and how it happens
this book starts off with a bang but has some seriously cliché and hackneyed scenes
when i first purchased this item it worked great
when there is as much sexual content between a young girl on her birthday than on the back cover of these books i think that might make me say you should go to your local library and borrow some classics before giving money to authors
as far as i can tell there 's not enough space anywhere on a page to put anything more than one word
my review wo n't explain why everything made no sense nor will describe what 's actually happening in this story
i like science but this book was very poorly written and edited
i found these to be the pits
also while it might be great to cleanse out toxins from your body i think those things are supposed to calm you not induce headaches
i 'm sending mine back don't waste your money or time unless your into frustration
but i would n't call it bad or even mediocre
the first half of this story kept me interested enough to keep reading but there were some issues that made it difficult to suspend disbelief
there were no broken pieces in it which made me wonder about quality control before sending them from hawaii
if you enjoy mindless nonsense like me then perhaps this book is for you but i would n't waste my money
it wo n't fit properly in my car 's lighter socket and i 'm afraid it will burn the engine if used for long
it got here in about 3 weeks
for more info find out your local library amazon must be deleting this book
did not get what it said it was was told i would get the box and product with it so when that did happen i never got this no tracking on product
i found myself in many situations where when my head touched the table or desk i leaned back and had a very bad whiplash effect
really ? no more than that
if you want one like this then spend $ 70 or so
these are the exact same lights as costco sells for 1/3 of the price
the graphics are just ok the game play itself is n't anything amazing
from the preview provided by amazon i thought this looked interesting
i had trouble put it down as well because of the suspense and horror aspects
there were several grammar and spelling mistakes in this book which really detracted from the enjoyment of reading it
i was looking forward with the expectation of receiving a very good book on how to read signs and learn sign language but my expectation have been met by the content
very cute rating 5
i bought this to take on trips
if i could give this product 0 stars i 'd rate it
for example he tells you not to allow chicken skin at all and if you follow his advice
when i got it most people are already complaining how flimsy and thin they have
i 'm disappointed given that he has always loved kong products
if you 're going the route that requires them being handled or stored safely i can say this is an extremely delicate product
and the computer shows its being plugged in so i 'm not even sure it 's turned on
it 's important what an author decides is needed but it 's also very easy for someone who is n't as experienced in writing on paper / digital media to skim over stuff without putting it into context
i will continue my search for a more powerful wireless connection
these are the worst ear buds i have ever bought so disappointing it is hard to believe people paid 20 bucks for this and i think the other reviewers must work at sonys
most of these at least to me were obvious
i must say that this book was extremely difficult to follow in the beginning although once it picked up got into more than just a few chapters then it finally started moving but at chapter four and five you start wondering what is going on because by page three of it you 're already out of it
the scroll wheel does n't click well and feels awkward when scrolling
too short & predictable
you got me right ? what gives ? i thought i was only going to purchase one song from her
they could make things clearer if they 'd actually change how they 're displayed because obviously it 's been changed slightly
i thought the coen brothers made some really good movies but not his new one
i bought these as a small gift for my son and girlfriend
after loving the hunger games movie and thought how great would be if she wrote as good as suzanne collins well guess what folks that is exactly how many people feel about this book they love books but they do n't always want them on their kindle
when i bought this game it came with a digital copy that had been activated via steam which meant it was always in the cloud
but we will give it to her
it is a cute message
if anything you should be ashamed as you write this this book does not deserve 5 stars and if you 've ever seen how these stories ended then that means it 's got an ending
i did notice that the unit would charge if connected to ac power however when plugged into usb port it did n't seem as fast
i do n't know why but my daughter and i could n't watch the whole movie
i have read my fair share of erotica but this is just an insult to both author and reader
well as someone who has read this twice now i must say that when compared to other modern day horror novels where we usually go with character driven psychological stories as opposed to ones such as the shining or rosemary 's baby the book seems rather simple on purpose
you can find cheap ones here or here
there were two major battles in wwii which happened many months apart yet these books fail terribly when describing it
for what you get they are good for general use if your cooking everyday or using mainly in small pots but if you cook alot like me then save up $ 99 to buy something better
because everybody else did that was my first sign that this novel is in reality little more than an extremely tedious advertisement for some sort of highend swiss vacation
it 's also very poorly edited some pages are n't even formatted properly to show where different characters are in each story
when i got it plugged in my printer and tested it
it came with no instructions and it was just loose in one of its plastic wraps
the price tag on the book seems to be about $ 7 dollars
do n't waste your money on their recipe book
if it 's good enough quality i will have another one
my father loved the case until you can hear noises when he talks
a book is incomplete because when you start reading a book there has been no attempt at putting words from first person and third person together or any other combination for that matter
i bought the first one of these had a few problems and then it stopped working entirely
what you get in this set it is the basic essentials of setting up your garden
it seems shady all around trying to charge people more money than they 're worth
my card has yet to arrive it took longer than promised although the estimated arrival date was set several weeks earlier by amazon
i received my copy of this album and loved it for the first day
on average on hard mode you get 35 kills per mission
this means although i 've had it a month or so it only works with one system amazon 's cloud based one
* the thermostat works but it 's not too useful
my review would be one star
as stated above i 'm still not completely convinced that what is shown by an image does n't actually look like what will come to you
so very upset about this
on another note i really like amazon 's return policy
will have my teacher check it out and take her notes on it
it appears that ubisoft has finally done it with another title in this series
the story was a great concept but the writing style and voice is pretty rough
so every night when we put our little ones to bed iwould come out of bed in order remove it
you can save yourself some time for a good laugh if that 's what your looking for with this dvd set
it worked ok for three times then the water supply began to go bad and it smelled hot & burned
i think this cd might be better used as wallpaper
was pretty upset with this
what exactly is the point of this thing ? is anyone really going to sit here and write down all their music so when they purchase a new computer they will get access to everything they 've ever downloaded onto it ? no
to sum up the entire game the puzzles are incredibly simple even on level 10 where the answer is right in front of you
this is my first day taking these pills
i love the scent of this and use it in my humidifier but as for cleaning it ? no
the author also gave us some interesting descriptions of different characters throughout the book
it fits fairly well but not perfectly
but i give it two stars for two good reasons one in this novella the author tries really hard even too hard i 'd say not to use any of those three things so as to make it less interesting
boring i kept waiting for a plot twist which never happened
i was very disappointed in this cd
for the cost it is okay if you 're trying to get you kids reading for fun / entertainment but overall i 'm disappointed
its ok if you do all your exercises every day and are able to hold out for results after 2 weeks then its okay just do n't expect to see much change unless you push yourself
my wife bought me one to use after an accident guess what she tried it out on herself
after only owning this case for 8 months the hard plastic cracked right where it connects to my ipad
i would like it better if there were more pockets
for large dogs i would strongly suggest finding something else this was nothing short of dangerous
in this flick three idiots go on adventures all over the planet trying to be cool and get laid
first of all i want to say that i have no problem with the quality or sound on this disc
the first time i charged it and attempted to use it something inside broke in half
some of the things in the book were interesting but a lot of it was so over the top that as soon as i got to one section even though i 'm well aware of all these kinds of things i quit reading it
it 's very nice but my kindleis about to fall apart at the seams one of the corners ripped when i tried pulling out one corner before putting in the kindle
as far as all other functionality it 's great i 'm looking for something similar with different colors
this might just be our unit but that 's what we found out
nor do i think you 're buying this piece mostly for protection you buy it because it 's purple
after seeing the excellent reviews for this product i purchased several cans
i 'm not picky when it comes to pillows ; i will take softness over being too squishy
bought this item based onreviews and looked to be comparable to apple product
after buying such an expensive camera this is unacceptable
this book has interesting plot ideas and excellent descriptive writing
i actually did read the entire thing cover to cover but it 's really just filler
after numerous tries a few attempts with other cf cards and just trying to return it amazon only had me rate it as okay '
otherwise they could get 5 stars the box says you can take it apart to play inside
first of all these are not 100 percent cotton as the product photo depicts they are 100 % polyester
they 've been released previously but no more
this is only one reason i have to give this product such an bad rating
alex 's struggles are understandable because some people go into debt for years hoping just one day be able to get out
i got it from here on amazon
i was excited by the claim that there is no filter to buy and if you want clean water then you 've found it it came with all of 7 screws to hold this unit together what a nightmare for me
for example i 'm not sure what kind of company the author was working for when he says to embrace risk and explore opportunities
i will look more carefully at anything i order in future
unfortunately mine was stolen so i 'd been using it to back up my photo files on an old computer
while it does have some helpful techniques and ideas the language is hard to read and the photography not as high quality as other books on quilting
the seller should explain why their junk product did not work
my advice for authors today is do n't get a publisher
the idea is great when playing with family members all at once but after a few rounds it gets stale as well
i tried to get into this book & i 'm a sucker for those good clean romances
let 's start with the positives
the hero is unbelievably stupid
i got everything put together and the power is on but no lights on
just like all other reviews say you must change both light bulbs yearly even though they come in sets ugh
to be blunt this camera is garbage
the binding fell apart into numerous pieces
after plugging them in only once the power failed
so back went the original headset purchased several years ago
i bought this for a friend who has an i phone 5 but as you can see it works for all other phones except the 5 which apparently does n't even work with adapters
as someone who loves and owns many books from oxford university press the problem was in amazon sending as well rather than one of their regular vendors
it 's just not powerful
when all said and done this seems like an unprofessional way of doing business
i found another vendor online
these are pretty and look quite nice although they do n't have any weight to thema bit flimsy for something you 're going to leave on your counter
she tells you to give a million dollars a year but then spends most of it on things like clothes at h&m while homeless people
fits my nook hd perfectly
maybe wait until later ?? then there are other sections which may not be useful as well
we did get them replaced quickly though they seemed pretty cool
bought this to use at work where i do n't have a computer
no idea what happened this was a really short story not really long enough as to hold my interest
do not buy this product you will waste your money
first off i 'm a college sophomore and i am not an idiot
however when playing back navigation directions while attached to the car mount all you ever get is static unless moving quickly up or down bumps
whole chickens beef etc
the design of the product makes installation incredibly difficult mostly because all that comes up behind it has to be cleaned first
when you read music from beginning of song or when it comes back to an earlier spot there will not be enough time left on cd
it took almost three weeks to get in the mail but once i finally did open it it was dirty and had scratches on it i want my money back its like they didnt even try this book before putting it into a shipping container im not happy at all i wanted this so bad = very misleading
do not waste your $ on this pos
the only interesting part was that it said everything i wanted to read in two pages of words the author had great ideas but failed miserably with the content
just do n't expect anything fancy
too unrealistic to enjoy at all
amazon did allow me return it
you will regret it
